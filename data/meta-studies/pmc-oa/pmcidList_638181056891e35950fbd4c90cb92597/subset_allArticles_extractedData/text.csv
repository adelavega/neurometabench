## Background 
  
Whereas acute nicotine administration alters brain function which may, in turn, contribute to enhanced attention and performance, chronic cigarette smoking is linked with regional brain atrophy and poorer cognition. However, results from structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies comparing smokers versus nonsmokers have been inconsistent and measures of gray matter possess limited ability to inform functional relations or behavioral implications. The purpose of this study was to address these interpretational challenges through meta-analytic techniques in the service of clarifying the impact of chronic smoking on gray matter integrity and more fully contextualizing such structural alterations. 


## Methods 
  
We first conducted a coordinate-based meta-analysis of structural MRI studies to identify consistent structural alterations associated with chronic smoking. Subsequently, we conducted two additional meta-analytic assessments to enhance insight into potential functional and behavioral relations. Specifically, we performed a multimodal meta-analytic assessment to test the structural–functional hypothesis that smoking-related structural alterations overlapped those same regions showing acute nicotinic drug-induced functional modulations. Finally, we employed database driven tools to identify pairs of structurally impacted regions that were also functionally related via meta-analytic connectivity modeling, and then delineated behavioral phenomena associated with such functional interactions via behavioral decoding. 


## Results 
  
Across studies, smoking was associated with convergent structural decreases in the left insula, right cerebellum, parahippocampus, multiple prefrontal cortex (PFC) regions, and the thalamus. Indicating a structural–functional relation, we observed that smoking-related gray matter decreases overlapped with the acute functional effects of nicotinic agonist administration in the left insula, ventromedial PFC, and mediodorsal thalamus. Suggesting structural-behavioral implications, we observed that the left insula’s task-based, functional interactions with multiple other structurally impacted regions were linked with pain perception, the right cerebellum’s interactions with other regions were associated with overt body movements, interactions between the parahippocampus and thalamus were linked with memory processes, and interactions between medial PFC regions were associated with face processing. 


## Conclusions 
  
Collectively, these findings emphasize brain regions (e.g., ventromedial PFC, insula, thalamus) critically linked with cigarette smoking, suggest neuroimaging paradigms warranting additional consideration among smokers (e.g., pain processing), and highlight regions in need of further elucidation in addiction (e.g., cerebellum).

## Background 
  
Over the past two decades, neuroimaging has contributed important insight into the structural and functional brain alterations linked with drug abuse in general [ – ] and nicotine addiction in particular [ – ]. For example, such studies have revealed that nicotine administration alters functional brain activity, inducing enhanced activity in some regions involved with attention and cognition (e.g., thalamus, lateral frontoparietal cortices, anterior cingulate cortex [ACC]) yet reducing activity in other regions involved with task-irrelevant mental operations (e.g., mind wandering; ventromedial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, parahippocampus) [ – ]. These functional brain alterations may, in part, provide a neurobiological account of the well-documented cognitive enhancing properties of acute nicotine administration [ ,  ]. On the other hand, chronic cigarette smokers, compared with nonsmokers, exhibit poorer global cognition and impaired performance on specific measures of working memory, cognitive flexibility, visuospatial learning and memory, and processing speed [ – ]. Aligning with such neurocognitive observations, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have detected reduced gray matter integrity among smokers in multiple discrete brain regions including the prefrontal cortex (PFC), ACC, insula, thalamus, and cerebellum [e.g.,  – ]. Such regional atrophy may result from the deleterious impact of cigarette smoking and/or reflect predisposing neurobiological, neurocognitive, or personality factors. 

However, structural MRI results among chronic smokers, to some degree, have been inconsistent. For example, gray matter in the insula of smokers has been reported to be decreased [ ,  ,  ], increased [ ], or comparable to that among nonsmokers [ ,  ]. Similarly, whereas some studies have detected smoking-related structural decreases in the ventromedial PFC [ ,  ,  ] or thalamus [ ,  ,  ], others have not [ ,  ,  ]. Heterogeneous findings may be the product of cross-sectional designs with modest-to-moderate sample sizes, between-study variability in participant attributes (e.g., varying age ranges, smoking histories, sex ratios, or other sociodemographic characteristics), and/or methodological differences in MRI acquisition or data analysis parameters (e.g., smoothing, registration techniques, or normalization templates). Such issues constrain interpretations from single studies and necessitate the post hoc integration of results from multiple independently conducted studies to better estimate parameters of interest [ ]. Accordingly, neuroimaging meta-analytic techniques have been increasingly adopted to delineate spatially convergent results across studies, including identification of consistently observed gray matter alterations among specific phenotypes [ – ]. 

Although useful for elucidating potential structural alterations among smokers, measures of gray matter are limited in their ability to inform interpretation of functional relations or behavioral implications. Regarding structural–functional relations, a plausible hypothesis is that brain regions showing chronic smoking-related structural alterations overlap those same regions showing acute nicotinic drug-induced functional modulations. One perspective is that the repeated impact of nicotine exposure within discrete brain regions over an individual’s extended smoking history culminates in neuroadaptations that may manifest as gray matter perturbations in those same regions. An alternative perspective is that pre-existing structural alterations may render some individuals more susceptible to acute pharmacologic effects and, in turn, to addiction. Regardless of the causative pathway (or combination thereof), integrating structural and functional neuroimaging results may provide insight into the neurobiological processes potentially contributing to the initiation, escalation, and/or maintenance of cigarette smoking. In other words, a multimodal perspective may allow for enhanced interpretation of structural alterations [ ,  ]. Regarding structural-behavioral implications, a frequently posed question not easily answered by considering morphometric outcomes is: what are the behavioral consequences of structural alterations in a particular brain region (or set of regions). As opposed to conjectural discussion of behavioral relevance, empirical approaches to more fully contextualize gray matter alterations are of growing interest [e.g.,  – ]. Such approaches provide an objective means to support behavioral interpretations and/or suggest neuroimaging paradigms warranting additional consideration among a particular phenotype. 

In the current study, we aimed to address these interpretational challenges by employing established and emergent meta-analytic techniques to clarify the impact of cigarette smoking on gray matter integrity and to more fully contextualize such morphometic alterations. The specific goals of our study were threefold. First, we sought to identify convergent structural alterations across studies associated with chronic smoking via the well-established, coordinate-based activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analytic framework. We operationalized the effects of chronic smoking as gray matter alterations identified in studies utilizing smoker versus nonsmoker comparisons. Second, we tested the structural–functional hypothesis that chronic smoking-related gray matter alterations overlap those same regions showing acute nicotinic drug-induced functional effects via a multimodal meta-analytic assessment. Whereas we operationalized   chronic effects   as structural alterations identified in smoker versus nonsmoker (i.e., between-subjects) comparisons, we operationalized the   acute effects   of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist administration as functional alterations indentified in pharmacological neuroimaging studies, the vast majority of which employed within-subjects (i.e., drug versus control condition) comparisons. Third, we sought to provide enhanced structural-behavioral insight via emergent database driven meta-analytic tools, which allow for the characterization of typical patterns of task-based co-activation and associated behavioral phenomenon for user-specified seed regions of interest. Specifically, using smoking-related gray matter alterations to define seed regions, we performed meta-analytic connectivity modeling [ ] and behavioral decoding assessments [ ,  ] on data archived in an extensive neuroimaging repository (  http://www.brainmap.org/  ) to objectively support behavioral interpretations of structural alterations. 


## Methods 
  
### Structural MRI study search and selection 
  
We performed an iterative literature search to compile structural neuroimaging studies interrogating gray matter alterations among chronic cigarette smokers compared with nonsmokers. In the first iteration, we searched the   Web of Science   (  http://www.webofknowledge.com  ) and   PubMed   (  http://www.pubmed.gov  ) databases for peer-reviewed articles with the following logical conjunction of terms: (“voxel-based morphometry” OR “morphometry” OR “gray matter density” OR “gray matter volume”) AND (“nicotine” OR “tobacco” OR “cigarette” OR “smok*”). In a second iteration, we consulted the bibliographies of recent review articles [ ,  ] and one existing meta-analysis [ ] for studies potentially not identified by the database queries. Although a previous meta-analysis has considered the structural impact of chronic smoking, we note that several additional studies have emerged subsequent to that report and highlight our emphasis on structural–functional and structural-behavioral relations as a further distinguishing characteristic. In a final iteration, we tracked the references of and citations to relevant papers, thereby compiling additional studies. 

We included studies in this meta-analysis that: (1) assessed gray matter using structural MRI, (2) reported a set of coordinates (i.e., foci) from a between-subjects contrast comparing smokers to matched nonsmoking participants, (3) reported coordinates in a defined stereotaxic space (i.e., Talairach or Montreal Neurological Institute [MNI]), (4) performed a whole-brain analysis, and (5) provided sufficient information regarding characterization of smoking behaviors (e.g., pack-years, Fagerström Test of Nicotine Dependence [FTND] scores, years smoking, number of cigarettes smoked per day), basic demographics of the study samples (e.g., age, sex,   N  ), and data analysis strategies (e.g., smoothing parameters, statistical thresholds). 

Accordingly, we identified 15 peer-reviewed articles involving 761 cigarette smokers and 1182 nonsmokers (Additional file  : Figure S1; Table S1) [ ,  ,  – ,  – ]. Across these 15 identified studies, the smoker samples were on average 41.8 ± 16.2 (mean ± SD) years of age and were composed of 40.9 ± 25.6 % females. At the time of scanning, smokers reported cigarette use for 22.9 ± 17.0 years, smoked 17 ± 4.0 cigarettes per day, and were moderately nicotine dependent as indicated by FTND scores (4.5 ± 1.3 out of 10). These characteristics were rather consistent across studies and are generally representative of community-based samples of smokers. The nonsmoker samples did not differ from smokers in terms of age (41.1 ± 17.5 years;   t  [14] = −0.9,   p   = 0.4) or sex (41.6 ± 25.0 % female:   t  [13]  = 0.5,   p   = 0.6). Most studies mitigated the influence of other drug use by screening via interview and/or urine toxicology on scan days (11 of 15 studies; Additional file  : Table S2). For each study, we also tabulated information on the type of MRI scanner used and data collection/analysis parameters (Additional file  : Table S2). All included studies utilized significance thresholds corrected for multiple comparisons or uncorrected thresholds combined with a spatial extent criterion. These studies distinguished gray matter alterations by the nonsmoker > smoker (i.e., smoking-related decreases) and smoker > nonsmoker directions (i.e., smoking-related increases). Of those included, 14 studies (78 foci) reported gray matter decreases among smokers and 5 studies (10 foci) reported increases. Given the limited number of studies and recent arguments that ALE meta-analyses based on less than 10 experiments/studies run the risk of obtaining results driven by a single experiment as opposed to identifying convergence across experiments [ ], gray matter increases were not considered further. 


### Structural impact of chronic cigarette smoking: meta-analytic procedures 
  
To identify areas of convergent gray matter decreases across studies, we performed a coordinate-based meta-analysis using the revised version [ ,  ] of the activation (in this application, Anatomic) likelihood estimation (ALE) algorithm [ ,  ] as implemented in   GingerALE v2.3.4   (  http://www.brainmap.org/ale/  ). ALE is a voxel-wise approach for combining neuroimaging results across a collection of experiments/contrasts and thereby identifying locations of statistically significant spatial convergence. The ALE framework models foci as centers of three-dimensional Gaussian probability distributions, thus accounting for spatial uncertainty due to within- and between-study variability. Foci are weighted by study sample size, where larger samples are associated with narrower distributions and smaller samples with wider distributions. We first linearly transformed foci reported in MNI to Talairach space [ ] and then generated modeled maps of each individual contrast using their respective foci (paralleling the modeled activation maps of functional MRI [fMRI] meta-analyses). Next, we calculated a voxel-wise ALE score (i.e., the union of all contrasts’ modeled maps) quantifying the spatial convergence of structural alterations across the brain. To identify clusters of statistically significant convergence, we compared these obtained ALE scores with those from an empirical null-distribution derived from a permutation procedure [ ]. This comparison resulted in nonparametric   p   value maps, which we then thresholded at a cluster-corrected level (  p   < 0.05; voxel-level:   p   < 0.005, cluster extent: 344 mm ) and exported to   MANGO   (  http://www.ric.uthscsa.edu/mango/  ) for visualization on an anatomical (Talairach) template. 


### Conjoint chronic smoking-related structural effects and acute drug-induced functional effects: multimodal meta-analytic procedures 
  
We leveraged previous meta-analytic outcomes regarding the impact of acute nAChR agonist exposure on brain function to enhance interpretation of structural alterations observed among chronic cigarette smokers. Specifically, in a previous meta-analysis [ ] we identified 38 pharmacological fMRI studies that assessed the acute functional effects of nAChR agonist administration (i.e. pharmacologic administration or cigarette smoking) relative to a baseline condition (i.e., placebo administration or smoking abstinence condition) across various cognitive and affective neuroimaging paradigms. The studies meeting selection criteria in that functional meta-analysis involved 796 participants, reported 364 foci from 77 contrasts, and distinguished functional activity modulations by the baseline > drug (i.e., activity decrease) and drug > baseline (i.e., activity increase) directions. We characterized the impact of nAChR agonists on brain function using the ALE framework (paralleling that described above) and separately identified brain regions showing either convergent activity increases or decreases using a cluster-level corrected threshold (  p   < 0.05). 

To test the hypothesis that smoking-related gray matter decreases overlap those same regions showing acute drug-induced effects, we conducted a multimodal meta-analytic assessment. Specifically, we performed a conjunction analysis to identify those brain regions, if any, showing statistically significant convergence when considering both: (1) chronic smoking-related structural effects (smokers versus nonsmokers), and (2) acute drug-induced functional effects (nAChR agonist manipulation versus control condition). Employing a conservative minimum statistic conjunction [ ], we identified brain regions showing conjoint structural and functional effects by computing the intersection of the two thresholded meta-analytic maps combined with an additional overlap-cluster extent criterion (100 mm ). 


### Behavioral relevance of structurally impacted regions: meta-analytic connectivity modeling and behavioral decoding 
  
As gray matter assessments possess limited ability to inform functional or behavioral interpretations, we subsequently employed emergent meta-analytic tools to more fully contextualize the brain circuit-level and behavioral consequences of structural alterations identified among smokers [ ,  ,  ]. Specifically, to determine whether structurally impacted brain regions reflect disruption of functionally interrelated neurocircuits, we utilized   meta-analytic connectivity modeling   (MACM), a validated database driven approach for delineating brain areas that co-activate with a seed region of interest (ROI) across many neuroimaging tasks [ ,  ,  ]. This assessment was conducted using the BrainMap database (  http://www.brainmap.org/  ) which is an online repository of over 13,500 neuroimaging contrasts from ~2800 journal articles (as of January, 2016) archived as three-dimensional coordinate-based results (  x  ,   y  ,   z  ) as well as relevant metadata describing the associated experimental design [ – ]. Whereas we utilized the database’s archived activation coordinates to characterize the co-activation/connectional profile of structurally-identified ROIs, we utilized the metadata to facilitate behavioral interpretation of smoking-related structural alterations via   meta  -  analytic behavioral decoding  . Although the data utilized in these assessments were from healthy participants, they nonetheless offer a useful path to enhance interpretation of observed structural alterations among smokers. These analyses attempt to identify within a typical range of function whether pairs of regions interact and, if so, under what behavioral context. If two brain regions are structurally impacted by a certain neuropsychiatric condition and those same regions also appear to interact among healthy participants under a specific behavioral context, one plausible inductive conclusion is that the psychological processes associated with that behavioral context may be disrupted in the neuropsychiatric condition. 

Moving beyond isolated regions, we conducted a MACM assessment to characterize the typical pattern of task-based, whole-brain co-activation for each of the structurally-identified ROIs. A MACM assessment aims to identify, across a domain-arching pool of studies interrogating various mental operations and task paradigms, brain areas that simultaneously co-activate with a user-specified seed region. In other words, a MACM assessment identifies brain areas most likely to be activated across all tasks, given activation within a seed. Similar to seed-based resting-state functional connectivity assessments of fMRI data, a MACM identifies those regions that are significantly related to, and presumably interact with the seed. First, we identified experiments in the database that reported one or more activation coordinates within a seed ROI using the   Sleuth   software application (  http://www.brainmap.org/sleuth/  ). The seeds were 8 mm radius spheres centered on the voxels with maximum ALE values within each of the smoking-related gray matter loss regions identified above. We conducted separate searches and computed separate MACMs for each of these ROIs. As practiced in previous MACM assessments to achieve sufficient power [e.g.,  ], only those ROIs associated with 30 or more experiments in the database were considered for further analyses. We employed 8 mm radial spheres to equate each ROIs volume and to seek a balance between returning a sufficient number of experiments from the database and minimizing overlap between ROIs that were in close proximity. Next, we extracted the whole-brain coordinates of all foci that co-activated with the seed, constraining this extraction to only activation foci (i.e., no deactivations) reported in studies examining healthy participants (i.e., no intervention or group comparisons). After converting foci reported in MNI to Talairach space [ ], we supplied these foci as input to the ALE methodology described above thereby delineating regions of convergent co-activation with the seed when employing a cluster-corrected threshold of   p   < 0.05 (voxel-level:   p   < 0.001). These thresholded MACM maps for each ROI represent the above-chance probability that identified voxels co-activated with the respective seed across many neuroimaging tasks. To determine whether smoking-related gray matter loss regions reflected disruption of functionally interrelated neurocircuits, we quantified the degree to which one ROI’s MACM map intersected with any of the other structurally impacted ROIs. If one ROI’s MACM map overlapped at least 50 voxels of any other ROI, those two regions were considered to constitute a circuit-level functional interaction. 

In addition to the co-activation coordinates, we also extracted the corresponding BrainMap metadata allowing for the generation of behavioral profiles for each pair of co-activating, and presumably functionally-related, ROIs. The metadata in the database are coded according to a well-defined taxonomy (  http://www.brainmap.org/taxonomy/  ) cataloguing each contributing study’s experimental design, stimulus type, behavioral domain (and subcategory), and paradigm class [ ,  ]. Under this taxonomy, behavioral domains (BD) represent the mental processes interrogated by the primary study’s statistical contrasts and comprise the main categories of   action  ,   cognition  ,   emotion  ,   interoception  , and   perception   as well as BD subcategories (BD-S; e.g.,   perception: somesthesis  -  pain  ). Paradigm classes (PC) further categorize the specific task employed (e.g.,   pain monitoring/discrimination  ,   Go/No  -  Go  ). We used these metadata terms to delineate behavioral phenomena linked with the concurrent activation of those pairs of structurally-identified ROIs considered to constitute circuit-level functional interactions in the above MACM assessments. 

Specifically, we created behavioral profiles for circuits of interest by performing forward and reverse inference analyses [ ,  ] on the associated distribution of metadata terms [ ,  ]. In the forward inference approach, we tested whether the conditional probability of brain activation given a particular behavioral phenomenon (i.e., BD, BD-S, or PC),   p  (Activation|Phenomenon), was higher than the baseline probability of brain activation,   p  (Activation). Baseline activation was defined as the probability of finding a random activation from the database in the region(s) of interest. Significance was established with a binomial test (  p   < 0.05). In the reverse inference approach, we identified the most likely behavioral phenomenon (i.e., BD, BD-S, or PC) given activation in a region. This likelihood,   p  (Phenomenon|Activation), was derived from   p  (Activation|Phenomenon) as well as   p  (Phenomenon) and   p  (Activation) using Bayes’ Rule. Significance was established with a Chi-squared test (  p   < 0.05). Only BD, BD-S, and PC terms that were significant in both the forward and reverse inference approaches are reported. 



## Results 
  
### Structural impact of chronic cigarette smoking 
  
To elucidate structural alterations associated with an extended smoking history, we conducted a meta-analysis identifying consistent gray matter decreases among smokers. This meta-analysis included 78 distinct foci from 14 peer-reviewed studies involving a total of 750 smokers and 1073 nonsmokers (Additional file  : Table S1). Across these studies, ALE revealed convergent gray matter decreases in 12 distinct clusters, notably in the ventromedial PFC (vmPFC), left insula, and mediodorsal (MD) thalamus, as well as in the medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC), ventrolateral PFC (vlPFC), dorsomedial PFC (dmPFC), medial PFC (mPFC), left parahippocampal gyrus, and right cerebellum (Fig.  ; Table  ).

### Conjoint chronic smoking-related structural effects and acute drug-induced functional effects 
  
To delineate regions displaying   both   structural alterations linked with chronic smoking   and   functional modulations linked with acute nicotinic agonist administration, we performed a multimodal assessment. Specifically, we conducted a conjunction analysis identifying regions showing both convergent: (1) smoking-related   structural   decreases (Fig.  ), and (2) nAChR agonist-induced   functional   decreases or increases [ ]. This multimodal assessment identified overlapping structural and functional effects within the vmPFC, left insula, and MD thalamus (Fig.  ; Table  ). Specifically, whereas gray matter decreases in the vmPFC and insula overlapped with clusters of acute drug-induced functional activity   decreases   (Fig.  , green; Additional file  : Figure S2), gray matter decreases in MD thalamus overlapped with drug-induced activity   increases   (Fig.  , orange; Additional file  : Figure S3). We arrived at similar outcomes and the same conclusions when performing this multimodal assessment when considering only functional studies involving nicotine administration (i.e., excluding other nAChR agonists; Additional file  : Figure S4) and when considering only functional results involving cigarette smokers (Additional file  : Figure S5).

### Behavioral relevance of structurally impacted regions: MACM and behavioral decoding 
  
To enhance insight into the circuit-level consequences of smoking-related structural alterations, we first performed a MACM assessment thereby identifying clusters of convergent co-activation for each of the structurally impacted ROIs. One region (mOFC) failed to return a sufficient number of experiments from the BrainMap database and was not considered further (Additional file  : Table S3). The remaining 11 whole-brain MACM maps represent voxels with an above-chance probability of co-activating with the seed when considering various neuroimaging tasks (Fig.  ; Additional file  : Table S4). For example, the MACM map for: (1) the   vmPFC   seed (Fig.  , ROI 3) indentified convergent co-activation within the posterior cingulate cortex, dmPFC, parahippocampus, and inferior frontal gyrus, (2) the   left insula   seed (Fig.  , ROI 11) displayed notable co-activation with the right insula, posterior medial prefrontal cortex (encompassing the ACC and supplemental motor area), the thalamus, parietal cortex, and cerebellum, and (3) the   MD thalamus   seed (Fig.  , ROI 12) encompassed the posterior medial PFC, bilateral insula, parietal cortex, and cerebellar regions. These and similarly-derived MACM maps delineating networks of task-based co-activation resemble networks identified when considering task-independent resting-state fMRI data [ ,  – ].   
Meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM) maps of task-related co-activation for each structurally impacted ROI. These thresholded MACM maps (  p   < 0.05) represent voxels with an above-chance probability of co-activating with the respective seed regions (8 mm radius   spheres   centered on the voxels with maximum ALE values within each smoking-related gray matter loss region). One region (ROI 8; mOFC) failed to return a sufficient number of contrasts from the database and was omitted from further analyses.   Numbering   corresponds to that in Table  . The seed ROI of each MACM map is outlined in   red  . MACM maps for ROIs   boxed   in   red   are discussed in the main text. See Additional file  : Table S4 for each seed ROI’s co-activation coordinates 
  

We then further assessed these co-activation maps to determine whether structurally impacted regions reflected functionally interrelated neurocircuits. Those structurally impacted ROIs that also appeared to be functionally related are summarized in Fig.  a. In this representation, the paths between regions indicate the observation of one ROI intersecting with another ROI’s MACM map. For example, the left insula’s MACM map (Fig.  a, ROI 11) overlapped the lateral posterior thalamus (ROI 1), cerebellum (ROI 10), and the MD thalamus (ROI 12) and vice versa (represented by double-headed arrows), whereas the left insula ROI was overlapped by the MACM map derived for the vlPFC seed (ROI 4, single-headed arrow). For the 11 ROIs, 12 unique paths were identified (out of 55; Additional file  : Figure S6) representing pairs of regions with an above-chance probability of co-activation.   
Pairs of functionally-related ROIs and associated behavioral phenomena.   a   Functionally-related ROIs are connected by paths, the directionality of which indicates that a given ROI (ending point,   arrow head  ) intersected another ROIs MACM map (starting point). We note that if one ROI overlapped another ROI’s MACM map, it did not necessarily indicate that the latter ROI overlapped with the former’s MACM map. See Additional file  : Figure S6 for an alternative representation.   b   Behavioral phenomena significantly associated with functionally-related ROIs were identified by forward and reverse inference assessments of metadata terms. In this representation, significant behavioral domains (BD) are represented by   path color   (perception [  purple  ], action [  red  ], cognition [  green  ], no significant BD [  gray  ]), significant behavioral domain subcategories (BD-S) are shown along the path in   bolded text  , and significant paradigm classes (PC) are in   standard text  .   Black paths   indicate that no significant associations were detected with any BD, BD-S, or PC 
  

To characterize behavioral phenomena linked with these pairs of functionally-related ROIs, we performed behavioral decoding via forward and reverse inference techniques on the associated BrainMap metadata terms (BD, BD-S, and PC). Those behavioral phenomena significantly associated with co-activation of ROI pairs are represented in Fig.  b. We highlight four observations from this assessment. First, the left insula’s co-activation with multiple other ROIs was linked with aspects of pain processing. Specifically, insula and vlPFC co-activation (Fig.  b, path: ROI 4–11) was significantly associated with the BD   perception   (purple), the BD-S   somesthesis  -  pain  , and the PC   pain monitoring/discrimination  . Similarly, concurrent activation of the insula and MD thalamus (Fig.  b, path: ROI 11–12) was linked with   perception  ,   somesthesis  -  pain  , and   pain monitoring/discrimination   in addition to the PC   recitation/repetition (overt)  . Insula and lateral posterior thalamus co-activation (Fig.  b, path: ROI 11–1) was associated with   perception   and   somesthesis  -  pain  . Second, the right cerebellum’s co-activation with multiple other ROIs was related to aspects of overt body movements. Specifically, cerebellum and insula co-activation (Fig.  b, path: ROI 10–11) was associated with the BD   action   (red), the BD-S   execution  -  speech  , and the PC   recitation/repetition  . Similarly, concurrent activation of the cerebellum and MD thalamus (Fig.  b, path: ROI 10–12) was related to   action  ,   execution   (non-speech),   execution  -  speech  , and   recitation/repetition   in addition to the PCs of   flexion/extension   and   Go/No  -  Go   (i.e., inhibiting an overt body movement). Co-activation of the cerebellum and lateral posterior thalamus (Fig.  b, path: ROI 10–1) was linked with the BD   action  , BD-S   execution   (non-speech), and PC   finger tapping/button press  . Third, co-activation of the parahippocampus and MD thalamus (Fig.  b, path: ROI 6–11) was related to the BD   cognition   (green), the BD-S   memory  -  explicit  , and the PCs   cued  -  explicit   and   recognition/recall  . Lastly, concurrent activation of the vmPFC and mPFC (Fig.  b, path: ROI 3–9) was associated with the PC   face monitoring/discrimination  . 



## Discussion 
  
We compiled structural MRI results to clarify the impact of cigarette smoking on gray matter integrity. Our meta-analytic results revealed convergent gray matter decreases among smokers in multiple regions including the prefrontal cortex, insula, thalamus, and cerebellum. Given that such structural measures provide limited insight into functional or behavioral implications, we subsequently performed two additional meta-analytic assessments to more fully contextualize these gray matter decreases. Indicative of a structural–functional relation, we observed via a multimodal assessment that chronic smoking-related structural effects overlapped with the acute functional effects of nAChR agonist administration in the vmPFC, left insula, and MD thalamus. Suggestive of structural-behavioral implications, we then identified pairs of structurally impacted regions that tended to co-activate across various tasks and delineated behavioral phenomena linked with such co-activation via MACM and behavioral decoding, respectively. These assessments linked the left insula’s co-activation with multiple other brain regions to pain perception, the right cerebellum’s co-activation with other regions to overt body movement, co-activation of the parahippocampus and MD thalamus with memory processes, and co-activation of medial PFC regions with face processing. 

Across studies, we observed convergent smoking-related structural decreases in discrete brain regions notably in the PFC (i.e., ventromedial, ventrolateral, dorsomedial, orbitofrontal), insula, thalamus, and cerebellum. Although we can only speculate on the pathogenesis of such decreases, structural differences between smokers and nonsmokers could be products of predisposing neurobiological risk factors [ ], the deleterious impact of cigarette smoking on microvascular functioning [ ], neurotoxic events (e.g., oxidative stress, inflammation) associated with many of the >4000 compounds present in tobacco smoke [ ], and/or be mediated directly or indirectly by nicotine itself. Focusing on the last possibility, nAChRs are ubiquitous throughout the human brain with particularly high densities in the thalamus, insula, and vmPFC [ ,  ]. Widespread upregulation of nAChRs, likely related to receptor desensitization from nicotine exposure, has been observed among smokers [ ,  ] and, conversely, smoking cessation associated with decreases in regional nAChR densities [ ]. Evidence from preclinical models suggests neurotoxic events and protracted consequences on cholinergic neurotransmission following nicotine exposure particularly during adolescence [ – ]. As such, one plausible mechanistic account is that repeated stimulation of high densities of nAChRs by nicotine may contribute to neurotoxicity within discrete regions and/or increase the vulnerability of those regions to other volatile compounds in tobacco smoke [ ] which ultimately manifest as gray matter decreases. 

Speaking to such an account, we conducted a multimodal meta-analytic assessment to determine if smoking-related structural decreases overlapped with nicotinic agonist-induced functional modulations and observed conjoint effects in the vmPFC, insula, and MD thalamus. In addition to possessing relatively high nAChR densities, these regions also are critically implicated in addiction-related psychological processes. For example, the vmPFC, in concert with other regions such as the OFC and striatum, is thought to play a role in representing subjective value information, behavioral choice selection, and evaluating outcomes and alterative rewards [ – ]. The insula, a functionally heterogeneous region, is involved with monitoring the physiological state of the body, appears causally related to the initiation, maintenance, and adjustment of attentional control, and likely plays a role in maladaptive decision-making among drug addicts [ – ]. Dysfunction of the MD thalamus, a primary node within a thalamic-PFC-basal ganglia network involved in associative learning, is implicated in the transition from goal-directed action (e.g., recreational drug use) to habitual forms of responding (e.g., dysregulated drug seeking) [ ,  ]. Consistent with the notion that structural alterations in these regions are a product of prolonged nicotine/tobacco exposure, group differences between smokers and nonsmokers within, for example, the insula were not detected among an adolescent/young adult participant sample with relatively lower exposure levels (0.9 ± 0.7 pack-years on average) [ ] but were observed among similarly aged individuals with relatively higher exposure levels (4.0 ± 1.8 pack-years) [ ]. Furthermore, multiple studies have provided evidence for dose-dependent exposure effects on gray matter integrity within the insula [ ,  ] and vmPFC [ ,  ,  ] as well as within the lateral PFC [ ,  ] and cerebellum [ ]. Widespread dose-dependent negative relations between pack-years and cortical thickness were recently corroborated in a large sample of older adults (  N   > 500) with particularly robust effects in the medial and lateral PFC [ ]. Interestingly, positive relations between number of years since last cigarette and cortical thickness, suggesting potential recovery with smoking cessation, were also detected in medial PFC and posterior insula regions, amongst others [ ]. Our multimodal meta-analytic outcomes add to a growing literature implicating the vmPFC, insula, and thalamus as contributors to the initiation, escalation, maintenance, and/or cessation of cigarette smoking. 

Representing one objective approach for providing insight into the behavioral relevance of convergent gray matter decreases among smokers, we utilized emergent meta-analytic tools to delineate structurally impacted ROIs that tended to co-activate and their associated behavioral phenomena. Similar approaches have been used to quantitatively aid interpretation of regions identified via structural assessments or networks commonly observed via resting-state fMRI (i.e., assessments inherently lacking direct behavioral insight) [ ,  ]. Although we adopted a quantitative approach to infer behavioral relevance of structural alterations, we note that our interpretations remain largely speculative until experimentally verified. We observed that co-activation of the left insula with thalamic and lateral PFC regions were generally linked with pain perception. Dysregulated pain processing is increasingly recognized as a potential barrier to smoking cessation [ ,  ] and emerging evidence suggests bidirectional relations between pain and smoking behaviors [ ,  ]. In laboratory assessments (e.g., cold pressor test), minimally-deprived or abstinent smokers, compared with nonsmokers, exhibit lower pain tolerance and report greater subjective experiences of pain where such pain reports positively correlate with nicotine withdrawal severity [ – ]. As such, nicotine abstinence may contribute to enhanced pain sensitivity that could maintain cigarette smoking via negative reinforcement mechanisms similar to other withdrawal symptoms [ ]. Although the insula’s role in interoceptive monitoring has been well characterized [ ] and higher nAChR availability in the thalamus, PFC, and cerebellum has been positively correlated with increased pain sensitivity among abstinent smokers [ ], relatively little neuroimaging work has focused on the neurobiological processes that may contribute to smoking- or withdrawal-related pain dysregulation. Our meta-analytic outcomes suggest that neuroimaging investigations of pain perception among smokers, with emphasis on the putative functional interactions between the insula and MD thalamus, may be a productive avenue for future research. 

We also observed that co-activation of the right cerebellum with insula and thalamic regions were generally linked with overt body movements. Acutely administered, nicotine augments performance in simple motor tasks [ ] and increases cerebellar vermis activity during externally paced finger tapping [ ]. On the other hand, chronic cigarette smokers perform worse than nonsmokers on neurocognitive measures of fine motor skills and postural stability [ ]. Smoking-related decreases in right cerebellum gray matter, identified via an ROI-based approach [ ] (i.e., a study not meeting inclusion criteria for the current meta-analysis), further corroborate our observation of convergent decreases in this region. Whereas our outcomes are consistent with the cerebellum’s critical role in motor coordination, they also align with contemporary views emphasizing the region’s contribution to cognitive processes [ ,  ] and relevance to drug addiction [ ,  ]. For example, we observed that co-activation of the cerebellum and MD thalamus was significantly associated with Go/No-Go paradigms that require inhibitory control. Although current neurobiological models of addiction have yet to provide an integrative account of this region’s contribution, altered cerebellar structure and function appears to be a common characteristic across drugs of abuse [ ]. Our meta-analytic outcomes serve to further draw attention to the cerebellum in the context of addiction in general and cigarette smoking in particular. 

Lastly, co-activation of the parahippocampus and MD thalamus was linked with memory processes and co-activation of medial PFC regions linked with face processing. Regarding the former observation, neurocognitive assessments have consistently identified visuospatial learning and memory deficits among older (>60 years) as well as middle-aged smokers (30–60 years) relative to nonsmokers [ ,  ]. Regarding the latter observation, as face processing paradigms often directly or indirectly involve affective components, a plausible interpretation is that smoking-related structural effects in medial PFC regions may relate to disrupted emotional processing and/or regulation [ ,  ]. Indeed, smokers tend to report elevated negative mood and a reduced ability to self-regulate such states when compared with nonsmokers [ ,  ]. 

Our findings should be considered in light of remaining issues. First, the ALE framework is a coordinate-based meta-analytic approach that does not incorporate the size of identified clusters from the primary studies, which leads to less precise representations relative to image-based approaches [ ], which, on the other hand, are themselves often less feasible. Second, we only considered gray matter decreases among smokers owing to a small number of reported experiments/foci in the literature with respect to increases. Nonetheless, neuroimaging studies have documented smoking-related volumetric increases in the caudate and putamen [ ,  ], positive correlations between putamen volume and lifetime nicotine/tobacco exposure [ ], and positive correlations between greater striatal volume and more intense cue-induced tobacco craving [ ]. Third, we followed previous recommendations that at least 10-15 experiments should be included in an ALE meta-analysis and note that the meta-analysis identifying gray matter decreases among smokers involved 14 studies. Based on recent data simulations [ ], closer to ~20 experiments has been prescribed to achieve sufficient power to detect moderately sized effects. Fourth, meta-analytic results are limited by the methodology commonly employed by the included studies. With respect to the use of T1-weighted MRIs to assess gray matter, we note recent commentaries regarding the potential for drug-induced cerebral blood flow alterations to complicate interpretation of structural outcomes [ ,  ]. Given that many studies included in this meta-analysis did not report the time elapsed between last cigarette smoked and MRI data collection (Additional file  : Table S2), this potential confounding factor cannot be ruled out. Fifth, our behavioral decoding outcomes are limited by the studies archived in the BrainMap database at the time of analysis as well as its associated taxonomy. Sixth, although some studies have begun to characterize the impact of smoking on gray matter in young adult/adolescent smokers [ ,  ], the concurrent influence of marijuana [ ] or alcohol use [ ], and sex differences among smokers [ ], as more studies accumulate regarding the influence of these and other important factors on gray matter alterations, it will become possible to better characterize the specificity of the meta-analytic effects identified herein. Lastly, it remains for future work, perhaps through multi-site longitudinal investigations, to determine whether regional structural alterations are a cause or consequence of cigarette smoking (or a combination thereof) and the extent to which such alterations recover following cessation. 

In sum, cigarette smoking was associated with convergent structural decreases across studies in the PFC, insula, thalamus, and cerebellum. Some of these chronic smoking-related structural effects overlapped with regions showing acute nicotinic drug-induced functional effects. This study highlights the utility of using neuroimaging meta-analytic techniques to compile, synthesize, and inform neuroimaging investigations aiming to elucidate the neurobiological factors underlying the initiation, escalation, maintenance, and/or cessation of cigarette smoking. Collectively, our findings emphasize brain regions (e.g., vmPFC, insula, thalamus) and circuits (e.g., insula-thalamus) linked with chronic smoking, suggest neuroimaging paradigms warranting additional consideration among smokers (e.g., pain processing), and point to regions in need of further elucidation in addiction (e.g., cerebellum).

Voxel-based morphometry
Functional connectivity
"," 
## Background 
  
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating disorder defined by the onset of intrusive, avoidant, negative cognitive or affective, and/or hyperarousal symptoms after witnessing or experiencing a traumatic event. Previous voxel-based morphometry studies have provided insight into structural brain alterations associated with PTSD with notable heterogeneity across these studies. Furthermore, how structural alterations may be associated with brain function, as measured by task-free and task-based functional connectivity, remains to be elucidated. 


## Methods 
  
Using emergent meta-analytic techniques, we sought to first identify a consensus of structural alterations in PTSD using the anatomical likelihood estimation (ALE) approach. Next, we generated functional profiles of identified convergent structural regions utilizing resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) and meta-analytic co-activation modeling (MACM) methods. Finally, we performed functional decoding to examine mental functions associated with our ALE, rsFC, and MACM brain characterizations. 


## Results 
  
We observed convergent structural alterations in a single region located in the medial prefrontal cortex. The resultant rsFC and MACM maps identified functional connectivity across a widespread, whole-brain network that included frontoparietal and limbic regions. Functional decoding revealed overlapping associations with attention, memory, and emotion processes. 


## Conclusions 
  
Consensus-based functional connectivity was observed in regions of the default mode, salience, and central executive networks, which play a role in the tripartite model of psychopathology. Taken together, these findings have important implications for understanding the neurobiological mechanisms associated with PTSD.

## Background 
  
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder in which the onset of symptoms develops after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event, such as violence, accidents, or combat [ ]. Symptoms associated with PTSD are categorized into clusters according to the DSM 5: (1) intrusion/re-experiencing trauma, (2) avoidance, (3) negative cognition and mood, and (4) hyperarousal [ ,  ]. Approximately 70% of adults experience at least one traumatic event in their lifetime and up to 20% of these people develop PTSD [ ]. Individuals with PTSD may experience long-term debilitating effects, mentally, physically, and cognitively. In the United States, roughly 8 million adults suffer from PTSD every year. Approximately 60% of men experience at least one traumatic event in their lives, often associated with combat and war, while 50% of women will experience at least one traumatic event, typically associated with sexual assault and abuse [ ]. 

Current theories aim to understand the etiology of PTSD, including behavioral, cognitive, and social models. Research suggests that reappraisal of traumatic events may lead to an overgeneralized threat response [ ]. Despite progress in understanding the vulnerability, symptomatology, and trajectory of PTSD [ ,  ,  ], the underlying neurobiological determinants of PTSD are less clear. Substantial prior work has attempted to identify structural brain alterations observed among individuals with PTSD. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) is a commonly used methodological approach for analyzing structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, allowing for quantitative statistical comparisons between groups (e.g., differences in gray matter volume; GMV) to more clearly understand the structural alterations associated with neuropsychiatric disorders, such as PTSD. Multiple prior meta-analyses have been conducted to identify convergent gray matter reductions in PTSD patients, although consensus across meta-analyses has not been reached. Each of these meta-analyses was conducted with a different scope, with varied study inclusion/exclusion criteria, and subsequently included a wide range of 8 to 20 studies. Varying convergence has been observed across these meta-analyses, which have identified one to five significant clusters in regions that include medial prefrontal cortex [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ], hippocampus [ ,  ], fusiform gyrus [ ,  ], and lingual gyrus [ ,  ]. Similarly, from a functional perspective, PTSD dysfunction has been reported as amygdala and frontal disruptions (e.g., [ ] or across alterations of large-scale functional brain networks (e.g., [ ] that are implicated in the tripartite model of psychopathology [ ]. While some studies have addressed consensus across functional neuroimaging studies, it is challenging to assess convergence across different psychological states and/or experimental paradigms, which has potentially contributed to inconsistent findings in PTSD meta-analyses of resting state [ ,  ] or task-based [ ,  ,  ] studies. Overall, this variability across meta-analytic approaches and results suggests that a consensus neurobiological model of PTSD has not yet been achieved. 

The objective of the current study was to apply current best practices in coordinate-based neuroimaging methods to investigate the topography of consistently reported structural alterations in PTSD. As PTSD is linked to a broad spectrum of neuropsychiatric symptoms, which likely reflects the disturbance of distributed, brain-wide neural circuitry, we also sought to functionally and behaviorally characterize any neuroanatomical alterations in a task-independent manner. To this end, we first identified convergent regions of gray matter (GM) reductions in PTSD vs. non-PTSD groups using anatomical likelihood estimation (ALE) [ ,  ]. Second, we identified the task-free resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) patterns, as well as the task-based meta-analytic co-activation modeling (MACM) patterns of convergent regions, thus providing multimodal functional connectivity profiles for each. Together, the VBM, rsFC, and MACM meta-analytic approaches have been used in previous clinically related meta-analyses [ ,  ,  ], they provide complementary information, yielding a multimodal functional connectivity profile for a given region of interest. Lastly, we applied meta-analytic functional decoding methods to identify the mental processes linked to this functional connectivity profile. Collectively, this work utilizes an innovative (meta-) analytic framework to quantitatively assess structural alterations associated with PTSD and the extended functional profiles of regions implicated in this disorder. A more comprehensive understanding of the neurobiological bases of PTSD is needed to delineate future pathways toward improved prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. 


## Methods 
  
### Analytic overview 
  
We first conducted a literature search to identify studies reporting structural alterations comparing the following groups: individuals with PTSD, individuals who experienced trauma but were not diagnosed with PTSD, and individuals who did not report experiencing trauma. A coordinate-based meta-analysis was performed using the ALE algorithm to identify convergent brain regions showing structural alterations associated with PTSD. We then used multiple connectivity modeling approaches to comprehensively characterize the functional connectivity of these convergent regions. Specifically, rsFC and MACM assessments were applied to identify the functional profiles of structurally altered regions associated with PTSD. Lastly, we used functional decoding techniques to identify behavioral profiles of the ALE, rsFC, and MACM results. An overview of our methodological approach is provided in   Figure   .

A   We first conducted a literature search to extract structural coordinates and entered them into the ALE algorithm to identify convergent structural alterations among PTSD vs. non-PTSD groups.   B   We next created task-free and task-based functional connectivity profiles for the convergent structural alterations.   C   Last, we performed functional decoding analyses on these functional profiles to make inferences about which mental functions were associated with our findings 
  


### Literature search and study criteria 
  
We conducted a comprehensive literature search to build a database of peer-reviewed MRI studies reporting structural alterations associated with PTSD from 2002 to 2020. In the first round of identifying studies, we examined previously published voxel-based morphometry meta-analysis papers on PTSD and compiled a list of included studies [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ]. Next, we performed a PubMed search to identify additional peer-reviewed, structural MRI studies of interest using the search terms “morphometry + PTSD”. The PubMed search aimed to identify any potential studies that were not included in the previously published meta-analyses. We then conducted a review of each identified publication to include the following study criteria: peer-reviewed MRI studies, reporting results among adult humans, written in the English language, focused on gray matter structural differences, and included original data (i.e., not a review). Subsequently, exclusion criteria were as follows: trauma or stressful life event studies not measuring PTSD, other non-voxel-based morphometry methods, treatment and longitudinal effects, papers reporting   a priori   regions of interest (ROIs), within-group effects, null effects, overlapping samples to previous studies, and studies that did not report coordinate-based results. 


### Anatomical likelihood estimation (ALE) 
  
ALE is a voxel-based meta-analytic technique that identifies convergent coordinates (i.e., foci) across a set of neuroimaging studies. Foci are treated as 3D Gaussian distributions to address variability within and between studies. We used the coordinate-based ALE method as implemented in NiMARE v.0.0.3 (Neuroimaging Meta-Analysis Research Environment; [ ], a Python library for neuroimaging meta-analysis. Reported coordinates were extracted from their original publication,coordinates originally reported in Talairach space converted to were MNI coordinates [ ,  ] so that all coordinates referred to MNI space. Once transformed, statistical probability maps were created for each foci and combined to model the likelihood that a given voxel displayed a between-group structural difference for each study. Observed voxel-wise ALE scores characterized the most consistently reported foci across the whole brain. Significance testing and correction for multiple comparisons involved thresholding the voxel-wise ALE map using a cluster-forming threshold of   P   < 0.001. Then, a permutation procedure was performed in which a null distribution of maximum cluster sizes was generated from 10,000 iterations of replacing reported foci with randomly selected gray matter voxels, generating ALE maps from the randomized dataset, and identifying the maximum cluster size after thresholding at   P   < 0.001. The cluster-level FWE correction threshold was set at   P   < 0.05, meaning only those clusters from the original, thresholded ALE map were retained if their size was greater than the cluster size corresponding to the 95th-percentile from the null distribution. We applied the above ALE procedure to identify convergent brain regions reflecting structural alterations between individuals with and without PTSD (i.e., PTSD vs. non-PTSD) separately for the contrasts of PTSD > non-PTSD and non-PTSD > PTSD. 


### Functional profiles of structurally altered regions associated with PTSD 
  
Next, we sought to characterize the functional connectivity patterns associated with regions demonstrating structural alterations in PTSD. To this end, we investigated task-free functional connectivity utilizing a database of resting state fMRI data, as well as task-based functional connectivity using a meta-analytic database of co-activation results. 


### Task-free functional connectivity: resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) 
  
Resting-state connectivity analyses typically identify brain voxels demonstrating the highest temporal correlation with the average time series of a seed ROI and provide context about the brain’s underlying functional architecture. To derive robust rsFC maps for each ROI, we utilized the minimally pre-processed and denoised (or “cleaned”) resting-state fMRI data provided by the Human Connectome Project’s [ ] Young Adult Study S1200 Data Release (March 1, 2017). On November 12, 2019, 150 randomly selected participants (28.7 ± 3.9 years) were downloaded via the HCP’s Amazon Web Services (AWS) Simple Storage Solution (S3) repository. The randomly chosen participants included 77 females (30.3 ± 3.5 years) and 73 males (27.1 ± 3.7 years). A difference in age between the two biological sex groups was significant but is consistent with the 1200 Subjects Data Release. Detailed acquisition and scanning parameters for HCP data can be found in consortium manuscripts [ ,  ,  ], but relevant scan parameters are briefly summarized here. Each participant underwent T1-weighted and T2-weighted structural acquisitions and four resting-state fMRI acquisitions. Structural images were collected at 0.7-mm isotropic resolution. Whole-brain EPI acquisitions were acquired on the 3T Siemens Connectome scanner: 32-channel head coil, TR = 720 msec, TE = 33.1 msec, in-plane FOV = 208 × 180 mm, 72 slices, 2.0 mm isotropic voxels, and multiband acceleration factor of 8 [ ]. 

The S1200 data release contained minimally pre-processed and denoised data. The minimal pre-processing workflow is described by Glasser and colleagues [ ], but consists of typical imaging pre-processing techniques that leverage the high-quality data acquired by the HCP. First, T1- and T2-weighted images were aligned, bias field corrected, and registered to MNI space. Second, the functional fMRI pipeline removed spatial distortions, realigned volumes to compensate for subject motion, registered the fMRI data to structural volumes (in MNI space), reduced the bias field, normalized each functional acquisition to its corresponding global mean, and masked non-brain tissue. Noteworthily, care was taken to minimize smoothing induced by interpolation and that no overt volume smoothing was performed. 

The fMRI signal contains many sources of variability, including artifactual and non-neuronal signals, that make identifying the underlying neuronal activity difficult. Using a combination of independent component analysis (ICA) and classification techniques, HCP functional data were automatically denoised using FMRIB’s ICA-based X-noiseifier [ ]. Briefly, ICA was performed on each functional dataset independently and characteristics of each component, such as spatial localization and power in high frequencies, were evaluated by a classifier to determine if a given component was related to neuronal activity or artifact. The time-series corresponding to artifactual components were then regressed out of the data, providing a “cleaned”, denoised dataset for further investigation. 

Using the minimally pre-processed, denoised resting-state datasets for each participant, the “global signal” was removed using FSL’s   fsl_glm   [ ] interface in NiPype [ ]. The “global signal”, although controversial in the domain of resting-state analyses, was removed under the premise that it performed better than other commonly used motion-correction strategies at removing motion-related artifacts in the HCP resting-state data [ ]. The resulting data set was then smoothed with a FWHM kernel of 6-mm using FSL’s   susaan   interface in NyPipe. For each participant, the average time series for each ROI was extracted and a whole-brain correlation map was calculated and averaged across runs for a single participant for every ROI. The average correlation maps for each participant were transformed to Z-scores using Fisher’s r-to-z transformation. A group-level analysis was then performed to derive a rsFC map for each ROI using FSL’s   randomise   interface [ ] in NiPype. Images were thresholded non-parametrically using GRF-theory-based maximum height thresholding with a (voxel FWE-corrected) significance threshold of   P   < 0.001 [ ], such that more spatially specific connectivity maps could be derived when using such a highly powered study [ ]. 


### Task-based functional connectivity: meta-analytic co-activation modeling (MACM) 
  
Leveraging reported coordinates from task-based fMRI studies, meta-analytic co-activation is a relatively new concept that identifies brain locations that are most likely to be co-activated with a given seed ROI across multiple task states. Differing from rsFC, MACM provides context about neural recruitment during goal-oriented behaviors. We therefore aimed to integrate these two complementary modalities by supplementing the rsFC maps with MACM maps for each ROI. To do so, we relied on the Neurosynth database [ ], which archives published stereotactic coordinates from over 14,000 fMRI studies and 150,000 brain locations. Neurosynth relies on an automated coordinate extraction tool to “scrape” each available fMRI study for reported coordinates. Due to the nature of this automated process, fMRI studies reporting results of multiple experimental contrasts as separate sets of coordinates are amalgamated into a single set of coordinates; in addition, “activation” and “de-activation” coordinates are not distinctly characterized. However, while this inherent “noise” may limit interpretational abilities, the power over manually curated datasets outweighs the potential confounds of bi-directional or mixed-contrast effects. 

To generate a MACM map for each ROI, we utilized NiMARE [ ] to search the Neurosynth database for all studies reporting at least one peak within the defined ROI mask. Neurosynth tools implement the multilevel kernel density analysis (MKDA) algorithm for performing meta-analyses based on a subset of studies, such as that described here. However, we opted to use the ALE algorithm as implemented in NiMARE given its optimal performance in replicating image-based meta-and mega-analyses [ ]. The ALE algorithm requires sample size information, or the number of subjects, that contributed to a given experimental contrast to generate a smoothing kernel. However, Neurosynth is not able to capture sample size (which could also vary across experimental contrasts within a study). Thus, we utilized a smoothing kernel with a FWHM of 15 mm, which has been shown to yield results with strong correspondence for image-based meta- and mega-analyses [ ]. The ALE algorithm was applied to the set of studies reporting activation within the boundaries of each ROI. Once ALE maps were generated for each ROI, as described above, voxel-FWE correction (  P   < 0.001) was performed to reflect the statistical thresholding approach used for rsFC maps. 


### Functional decoding: generalized correspondence latent dirichlet allocation (GC-LDA) 
  
We sought to infer what mental processes were most likely linked with brain regions identified in our ALE, MACM, and rsFC analyses. To do so, we utilized generalized correspondence latent Dirichlet allocation (GC-LDA) functional decoding methods in NiMARE applied to the resulting unthresholded ALE, rsFC, and MACM maps. This type of decoding provides an approach to infer mental processes associated with neuroimaging spatial patterns. GC-LDA utilizes probabilistic Bayesian statistics that learns latent topics from a large database of papers (e.g., NeuroSynth) [ ]. From the database, each topic found is treated as a probability distribution and creates a spatial distribution in MNI space across voxels from the maps entered into the decoding algorithm. The “topics” encompass terms and associated brain regions that co-occur in the literature from a literature database. We set our model to 200 topics. We report 10 terms corresponding to the highest weights associated with our ALE, rsFC, and MACM results. 



## Results 
  
### Literature search and study criteria 
  
The literature search yielded a total of 85 articles using the above-described search terms. Figure   provides a PRISMA diagram, which details the review and filtering of those 85 studies. In the first round of review, records (i.e., titles and abstracts) were screened to exclude 18 studies that corresponded to non-human or non-English studies, reviews, or studies reporting white matter differences or differences among children or adolescents. Then, we examined the full-text articles to assess additional study criteria; 44 additional studies were excluded as being not eligible for the current meta-analysis.

The final set of included studies consisted of 23 publications. Within these publications, gray matter structural alterations were assessed by comparing whole-brain VBM results among individuals with and without PTSD, reported as 3D coordinates in MNI or Talairach space. Control comparison groups included individuals who had experienced trauma but did not develop PTSD and individuals who had not experienced trauma. Nineteen publications included trauma-exposed controls (TC), while ten publications included healthy, non-trauma-exposed controls (HC). Altogether, this set of 23 studies collectively examined 476 individuals with PTSD and 892 individuals without PTSD, which included 288 TC and 633 HC. With respect to the type of structural alterations observed, studies reported multiple different VBM metrics. Seventeen publications reported group differences in gray matter volume (GMV), seven publications reported differences in gray matter density (GMD), and one reported gray matter concentration (GMC). Collectively, we refer to all of these metrics as gray matter (GM) differences among individuals with and without PTSD. Additional details on the demography of participant groups and study design are provided in Additional file  : Table S1 located in this project’s GitHub repository (  https://github.com/NBCLab/meta-analysis_ptsd  ). 

Within this final set of 23 publications, multiple contrasts of interest were reported. 25 contrasts reported GM   decreases   in PTSD vs non-PTSD for a total of 159 foci; this included 16 contrasts for PTSD vs. TC (82 foci) and 9 contrasts for PTSD vs. HC (77 foci). Conversely, 6 contrasts reported GM   increases   in PTSD vs. non-PTSD for a total of 20 foci, including 3 for PTSD (9 foci) vs. TC and 2 contrasts for PTSD vs. HC (9 foci). 


### Anatomical likelihood estimation (ALE) 
  
Using NiMARE v.0.0.3 [ ], ALE meta-analysis was performed to assess convergence for the 25 contrasts from 22 publications of GM decreases among individuals with and without PTSD (i.e., non-PTSD > PTSD); a complete listing is provided in Table  . Neuroimaging simulations indicate that a minimum of 20 contrasts are necessary for a well-powered coordinate-based meta-analysis [ ]. Thus, we were unable to assess the 6 contrasts of GM   increases   (i.e., PTSD > non-PTSD) given insufficient power. With respect to GM decreases, we observed a single cluster of convergence located in the mPFC (x=0, y=46, z=10; BA 32) (Figure  ;   P   < 0.001, FWE-corrected   P   < 0.05). Given these results, we performed additional ALE meta-analyses for the PTSD vs. TC and PTSD vs. HC contrasts (i.e., GM increases and decreases) to determine if the use of different comparison groups potentially contributed additional heterogeneity, limiting assessment of convergence. However, we observed null results for these additional contrasts as well, likely in part due to the underpowered samples [ ].

### Functional profiles of structurally altered regions associated with PTSD 
  
We next investigated the functional connectivity of the mPFC cluster identified above showing convergent gray matter reductions among individuals with PTSD. To this end, we analyzed task-free rsFC and task-based MACM. First, we generated a rsFC map using the ALE-derived mPFC cluster as a seed region. The resultant rsFC map revealed rsFC with the superior frontal gyrus, medial frontal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, ACC, thalamus, posterior cingulate (PCC), superior temporal gyrus, medial temporal gyrus, precuneus, cuneus, and parahippocampus. Next, to further examine functionally coupled regions with the mPFC seed, we generated a MACM map using the Neurosynth database which demonstrated task-based coactivations with a similar pattern as the rsFC map. The locations of rsFC and MACM results are provided in Table  . Figure   illustrates the rsFC (blue) and MACM (red) results, with overlapping regions, indicating a consensus between rsFC and MACM (pink), revealed in the ACC, medial prefrontal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, insula, inferior parietal lobe, thalamus, precuneus, parahippocampus, insula, and PCC regions (Table ).

### Functional decoding: generalized correspondence latent dirichlet allocation (GC-LDA) 
  
Lastly, we performed functional decoding of the structural ALE, rsFC, and MACM maps to provide insight into the behavioral functions putatively associated with the observed functional connectivity patterns. Functional decoding was conducted using a GC-LDA analysis [ ]. Because GC-LDA does not provide correlational or statistical rankings, the top 10 unique terms computed from the GC-LDA analysis were taken into consideration separately for the structural ALE, rsFC, and MACM maps. The decoding terms with the top 10 weights from the GC-LDA analysis for the structural ALE map were: visual, emotional, memory, novel, reward, motor, self, faces, learning, and face (Table  a). The decoding terms with the top 10 weights from the GC-LDA analysis for the rsFC map were: default, default mode network, intrinsic, scale, self, person, reward, bias, judgements, and contexts (Table  b). Topographically speaking, the rsFC results resembled regions of combined default mode [ ,  ] and salience networks [ ,  ], and the functional decoding outcomes suggested that the rsFC results were associated with self-referential, intrinsic, and reward processes. Next, we examined MACM-based decoding results. The decoding terms with the top 10 weights from the GC-LDA analysis for the MACM map were: visual, motor, emotional, memory, attention, auditory, reward, spatial, schizophrenia, and language (Table  c). Topographically speaking, the MACM results also resembled regions of the default mode [ ,  ] as well as the frontoparietal central executive network [ ,  ], and the functional decoding outcomes suggested association with executive emotional and memory processes. A summary of the decoding analyses for all three sets of images is shown as a radar plot in Figure  .

## Discussion 
  
The overall objective of this study was to investigate convergent alterations in brain structure among individuals with PTSD using emergent meta-analytic techniques. Further, we sought to extend the literature and assess potential functional consequences associated with observed structural alterations in PTSD by applying complementary rsFC and MACM analytic techniques. The current meta-analysis of 23 VBM studies evaluating GM volume alterations among PTSD versus non-PTSD groups identified a single node of convergent gray matter loss in the mPFC. GC-LDA-based functional decoding of this cluster was linked to Neurosynth terms of visual, emotional, memory, novel, reward, motor, self, faces, learning, and face. Follow-up ALE analyses exploring GM reductions in PTSD vs. HC (non-traumatized controls) and PTSD vs. TC (trauma-exposed controls not diagnosed with PTSD) yielded null findings likely due to insufficient power [ ]. Subsequent analyses of the ALE-derived mPFC cluster were conducted to assess task-free (rsFC) and task-dependent (MACM) functional connectivity, identifying a consistent and widespread functional network implicated in PTSD. These results indicate that structural alterations in the mPFC among individuals with PTSD are possibly linked to disruptions across a larger frontoparietal network that includes the medial, superior, and inferior frontal gyri, PCC, parahippocampal gyri, angular gyri, superior temporal gyrus, thalamus, caudate, and lentiform nucleus. Functional decoding of rsFC and MACM results indicates substantive term overlap with the mPFC ALE results, with additional network-related terms (e.g., default, default mode network, and intrinsic). 

### Structural alterations and dysfunction in PTSD 
  
Our current findings suggest the mPFC appears as the most consistently reported brain region across VBM neuroimaging studies exploring the impact of PTSD on brain structure. Previous meta-analyses have identified GM reductions in the mPFC, hippocampus, fusiform gyrus, and lingual gyrus; however, not all of these regions were consistently observed across all meta-analyses [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ]. Beyond the mPFC, we did not observe additional convergent GM reductions, indicating that prior findings in these other regions were not replicated. Across the PTSD literature, there is a high degree of variability associated with participant trauma exposure, length of diagnosis of PTSD, medication use, and comorbidity. Inconsistencies between our findings and previous meta-analytic results could be due to conceptual and methodological differences across the earlier studies, such as the scope of the research question exploring the neurobiology of PTSD, and the subsequent differences in inclusion/exclusion criteria that resulted in different sets of included studies. Comparison of the included studies in this and prior VBM meta-analyses of PTSD indicated varying degrees of overlap, including (from earliest to most recent meta-analyses): 7 of 9 included studies [ ], 14 of 17 included studies [ ], 15 of 20 included studies [ ], 7 of 13 included studies [ ], 7 of 8 included studies [ ], and 10 out of 12 included studies [ ]. 

Beyond selection of included studies, the meta-analytic approach may contribute to the source of variability across results. Previous meta-analyses used either the ALE approach [ ,  ] or signed differential mapping [ ,  ,  ,  ]. Consistent with the present results, the meta-analyses by Meng et al. [ ] and Klaming et al. [ ] also yielded a single cluster in mPFC, which used the SDM method while our current results used the ALE approach. However, of all prior meta-analyses, only the study by Meng et al. [ ] meets the current threshold of a minimum of 20 contrasts for a well-powered coordinate-based meta-analysis [ ]. After reviewing the above prior meta-analytic work in comparison to our current results, we conclude that extensive heterogeneity in the PTSD literature, combined with varying meta-analytic inclusive/exclusion criteria, likely contributed to differences between our results and prior meta-analytic findings. To our knowledge, the current meta-analysis of 25 contrasts represents the largest PTSD meta-analysis of structural findings to date, with prior meta-analytic work examining 8-20 included studies. We observed that the mPFC is robustly associated with structural alterations in PTSD; however, it is important to consider how the mPFC is integrated within existing neurocircuitry models associated with PTSD symptomology. 

Traditional neurocircuitry models of PTSD utilize a fear-conditioning framework, emphasizing hyperreactivity of the amygdala in response to fear-related stimuli and dysfunction between the mPFC and orbitofrontal cortex, as well as the hippocampus, in attention and top-down control during threat exposure [ ,  ]. However, limiting consideration of the psychopathology of PTSD to focus on a single brain region (i.e., the amygdala) emphasizes fear-related brain activity while minimizing brain circuitry implicated in the complex constellation of PTSD symptoms associated with response to trauma exposure, such as re-experiencing trauma, avoidance, negative mood, and numbing. These additional processes remain largely unexplained in original PTSD models. However, more recent neurocircuitry models build from this perspective, with increased emphasis on altered function of the mPFC, its role in contextualization, and how context processing is core to the constellation of PTSD symptoms [ ,  ]. While our results indicated convergent structural alterations in the mPFC, we did not observe similar convergence in the amygdala or other regions that have been implicated in prior neurocircuitry models of PTSD [ ,  ,  ,  ]. However, our results are congruent with the expanded models of PTSD and we provide robust evidence in support of the mPFC as a critical node in PTSD neurocircuitry. Further, our functional decoding results provide additional support for the contextualization models of PTSD. Taken together, reduced GM in the mPFC among individuals diagnosed with PTSD supports the premise that these structural alterations may contribute to deficits in context processing and ultimately play a dominant role in contributing to behaviors related to the constellation of symptoms in PTSD [ ,  ]. 


### Functional profiles of structural findings in PTSD: support for the tripartite model of psychopathology 
  
rsFC and MACM analyses characterized mPFC functional connectivity as extending across widespread, whole-brain networks engaging frontoparietal and limbic regions. These rsFC and MACM results, in conjunction with functional decoding outcomes, identified a functional connectivity profile suggestive of spatial patterns associated with the default mode network (DMN) [ ,  ], salience mode network (SN) [ ,  ], and central executive network (CEN) [ ,  ]. The DMN is a system of connected brain areas including the mPFC, PCC, inferior parietal, and temporal cortices that are often collectively observed as displaying anticorrelation with regions actively engaged during attention-demanding tasks. Areas of the DMN are thought to collectively contribute to mental processes associated with introspection and self-referential thought [ ,  ,  ]. The SN consists of the dorsolateral ACC and bilateral insula and is involved in saliency detection and attentional processes [ ,  ]. Finally, the CEN consists of the dorsolateral prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices and is typically involved in attentionally driven cognitive functions, including goal-directed behavior [ ]. These three networks are central to a neurobiological theory of psychopathology [ ,  ,  ]. The application of the tripartite model to neurobiology models of psychiatric disorders define dysfunction within and between connectivity of the DMN, SN, and CEN networks and relates to a broad range psychiatric disorders [ ], including PTSD [ ,  ]. Overall, the current meta-analysis identified a functional profile of the mPFC associated with connectivity between the DMN, SN, and CEN, which broadly supports a network theory of PTSD [ ,  ]. 

According to the tripartite model of brain function, the SN is thought to mediate activity between the DMN and CEN networks in order to orient to external stimuli or internal salient biological stimuli [ ], Sripada et al. [ ]. Altered inter- and intra-network functional connectivity between the DMN, SN, and CEN has previously been implicated in PTSD [ ]. Specifically, seed-based resting state studies identified decreased connectivity within the DMN and SN, yet increased connectivity between these two networks among PTSD patients (Sripada et al. [ ]). Furthermore, other resting state studies on PTSD utilizing graph theory approaches [ ] and independent component analysis [ ] replicated weakened connectivity within the DMN, SN, and CEN, yet heightened connectivity between the DMN and SN [ ,  ]. Taken together, this literature suggests deficits in top-down control over heightened responses to threatening stimuli and abnormal regulation of orienting attention to threatening stimuli [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ]. Patterns from task-based studies reflect previous findings of weakened connectivity between the SN and DMN and heightened connectivity between the SN and CEN [ ,  ]. In a study among individuals with recent trauma exposure, connectivity between the DMN, SN, and CEN was reported to be disrupted among participants who developed PTSD vs. those who do not [ ,  ], providing evidence of differential functional connectivity between PTSD patients and traumatized non-diagnosed individuals. Network dysfunction associated with the DMN, SN, and CEN is also evident in task-based studies, including cues containing trauma stimuli [ ], eye gaze [ ], and a broad range of behavioral paradigms [ ]. Aberrant connectivity between and within the DMN, SN, and CEN has also been associated with PTSD symptoms, such that heightened connectivity and activity of the DMN was associated with depersonalization/derealization, while weakened connectivity and activity of the CEN was associated with hyperarousal and hypervigilance [ ]. Additionally, weakened inter-network connectivity between the SN and DMN has been found to be positively correlated with Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) scores that measure PTSD symptom severity [ ,  ]. Moreover, Bluhm et al. [ ] found weakened spontaneous activity in regions of the DMN; in addition, posterior cingulate connectivity was positively correlated with self-reported dissociated experiences among participants with PTSD. In sum, the literature on abnormal brain function associated with PTSD points to a pattern of results suggesting that symptoms are related to aberrant connectivity within and between the DMN, SN, and CEN. In a recent review of the neuroimaging literature on PTSD, Lanius et al. [ ] summarized this work to reflect that dysfunction in the DMN is associated with an altered sense of self, dysfunction in the SN is associated with hyperarousal and hypervigilance, and dysfunction in the CEN is associated with cognitive dysfunction, including memory and cognitive control deficits. 

The results from the current meta-analysis provide a robust mPFC-centric model of PTSD that is aligned with the extant literature and compliments the tripartite model of psychopathology. The mPFC, a core region of the DMN [ ,  ], is often disrupted in individuals with PTSD [ ,  ]. The results of the present meta-analysis suggest alterations in mPFC structure, and related function, may play a crucial role in the underlying neurobiology of PTSD. Dysfunction of the mPFC is thought to be associated with poorer regulation of contextualization of PTSD symptoms. Prior literature indicates weakened integration of the DMN and disrupted inter-network connectivity with the SN and CEN, representing aberrant dysfunction of these tripartite networks in the psychopathology of PTSD [ ]. Most of the prior functional and structural work involved varying analytic approaches, examined heterogeneous populations, and utilized region of interest approaches or   a priori   hypotheses. The current application of advanced meta-analytic techniques allowed for a whole-brain assessment of structural alterations associated with PTSD and the associated functional profiles of the mPFC. Future work in PTSD should consider integrating network-based analytic approaches with an mPFC-centric tripartite model to investigate differences in neuropathology of PTSD subtypes (e.g., trauma experiences, duration of exposures), characterizing heterogeneous presentations of PTSD symptoms, and potential predispositional developmental effects among youth, adolescent, and adult populations. 



## Limitations 
  
Our study is limited by several considerations. First, the present meta-analysis is limited by the small number of studies included. The studies that met the standards of inclusion for this study were considered to reduce instances of variance and consider reliability of study findings (inclusion and exclusion criteria are shown in Fig.  ). By considering the inclusion of trauma-exposed controls, healthy controls, and individuals with PTSD, the number of participants across each group was somewhat unevenly distributed due to small sample sizes in the original studies. However, the current meta-analysis met the previously recommended standard of at least 20 experimental contrasts required to conduct a well-powered meta-analysis [ ]. Second, much heterogeneity exists across the studies included in our meta-analysis. For example, many of the studies had diagnostic criteria for PTSD using different clinical measures and reported different instances of the duration of PTSD (e.g., lifetime vs. first onset). Substantial variability was also present in the type of trauma and duration of exposure to trauma within the different groups for this study. Given these issues, we were unable to classify PTSD subtypes across the included studies and thus have reported results that relate to generalized PTSD. Many of the original studies were not able to clearly disentangle comorbidity of PTSD with other psychiatric disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety) or report instances of medication and drug abuse. Furthermore, studies relied on various neuroimaging acquisition and analysis methods, which likely introduced additional variability associated with methodological flexibility [ ,  ]. However, the goal of neuroimaging meta-analysis was to examine consensus despite such variability in the literature. With this in mind, we are confident that the mPFC is a significant brain region linked to GM reductions in PTSD, as well as a robust node of the DMN that plays an important role in toggling between the DMN, SN, and CEN. Future transdiagnostic and meta-analytic work is needed to identify similar and unique neurobiological mechanisms of PTSD in comparison to other related disorders, including complementary disease-decoding or structural covariance analysis, which would further advance clinical insight. 


## Conclusions 
  
The present study utilized coordinate-based meta-analytic techniques to determine that reduced mPFC GM is consistently found among individuals with PTSD. Complementary analyses of rsFC and MACM functional connectivity provided novel insight into how structural alterations may have potential functional consequences. Our results indicated that decreases in mPFC GM may be linked to widespread functional systems that are implicated in behavioral deficits and cluster symptomatology of PTSD. Specifically, consensus-based functional profiles, across task-free and task-based domains, emphasized brain regions associated with the tripartite model of psychiatric disorders where inter- and intra-network connectivity involving the DMN, SN, and CEN are core to PTSD dysfunction. Overall, these results may be important in providing a more comprehensive understanding of the neurobiological bases of PTSD, which is needed to understand the varying diagnosis, symptomatology, and treatment of PTSD, as well as enhanced targeting of treatment towards heterogeneous classification and symptom clusters of PTSD.

Cognitive processes do not occur by pure insertion and instead depend on the full complement of co-occurring mental processes, including perceptual and motor functions. As such, there is limited ecological validity to human neuroimaging experiments that use highly controlled tasks to isolate mental processes of interest. However, a growing literature shows how dynamic, interactive tasks have allowed researchers to study cognition as it more naturally occurs. Collective analysis across such neuroimaging experiments may answer broader questions regarding how naturalistic cognition is biologically distributed throughout the brain. We applied an unbiased, data-driven, meta-analytic approach that uses   k  -means clustering to identify core brain networks engaged across the naturalistic functional neuroimaging literature. Functional decoding allowed us to, then, delineate how information is distributed between these networks throughout the execution of dynamical cognition in realistic settings. This analysis revealed six recurrent patterns of brain activation, representing sensory, domain-specific, and attentional neural networks that support the cognitive demands of naturalistic paradigms. Although gaps in the literature remain, these results suggest that naturalistic fMRI paradigms recruit a common set of networks that allow both separate processing of different streams of information and integration of relevant information to enable flexible cognition and complex behavior. 
   Author Summary  
Naturalistic fMRI paradigms offer increased ecological validity over traditional paradigms, addressing the gap left by studying highly interactive cognitive processes as isolated neural phenomena. This study identifies the connectional architecture supporting dynamic cognition in naturalistic fMRI paradigms, the first meta-analysis of a wide range of more realistic neuroimaging experiments. Here we identify and characterize six core patterns of neural activity that support functional segregation and integration in large-scale brain networks. This study provides a unique investigation of the cooperating neural systems that enable complex behavior.

## INTRODUCTION 
  
Across the life sciences, researchers often seek a balance between ecological validity and careful laboratory control when making experimental design decisions. This entails weighing the value of creating realistic stimuli representative of real-world, interactive experiences versus artificial, reductionist stimuli facilitating precise assessment of “isolated” mental process of interest via cognitive subtraction.   assumes that a single added cognitive process does not alter the other, co-occurring processes, both neutrally and cognitively. As such, task-based fMRI has traditionally utilized precisely controlled tasks to study the neurobiological substrates of cognition. However, cognition does not occur by pure insertion; the functioning of any cognitive process is not wholly independent from other co-occurring processes (Friston et al.,  ). Instead, cognition is highly interactive, encompassing measurable changes in neural activity that are dependent on the full amalgamation of relevant social, cognitive, perceptual, and motor processes. Thus, it is perhaps unreasonable to expect findings from a highly restricted assessment of a psychological construct in the scanner to fully generalize to real-world behaviors and settings. 

With advances in technology and a desire to study cognition with greater ecological validity, increasing numbers of studies are utilizing realistic, interactive, and rich stimuli in more ecologically valid experimental designs that fit within the scanner’s confines (Hasson & Honey,  ; Maguire,  ; Wang et al.,  ). “Naturalistic” paradigms employ dynamic and complex stimuli (Fehr et al.,  ; Kauttonen et al.,  ; Burunat et al.,  ), in terms of multimodal demands (Lahnakoski et al.,  ; Maguire,  ; Nardo et al.,  ; Dick et al.,  ; Reed et al.,  ; Bishop & Miller,  ), or in relation to the length of the stimulus presentation (Maguire,  ; Cong et al.,  ). Specifically, the use of video games, film clips, and virtual reality, among others, has brought a new dimension to cognitive neuroimaging experiments, permitting researchers to study brain activity as participants engage in tasks that more closely represent real-life demands on attention and multimodal sensory integration. Appreciation of such attention and integration processes necessitates more complex stimuli than simple static images presented on a screen. For example, researchers have studied spatial navigation with virtual reality environments as complex as the city of London (Spiers & Maguire,  ) and as classic as a virtual radial arm maze (Marsh et al.,  ). Similarly, social cognition has been probed with displays of human social interactions from a dramatic, social television drama (Spunt & Lieberman,  ) to clips of facial expressions with little context (Li et al.,  ). 

Everyday activities, such as navigation or social observation, involve the integration of processes associated with object recognition, speech comprehension, motor control, and spatial orienting, which all require the interpretation of dynamic signals often from more than one sensory modality (e.g., audiovisual film watching or visuotactile image tracing) and necessitate different attentional demands compared with the simplistic stimuli used in traditional fMRI experiments (Giard & Peronnet,  ; McGurk & MacDonald,  ; Sailer et al.,  ; Spence,  ). Recently, this trend has produced open-source efforts such as studyforrest, a freely available dataset of MRI scans, eye-tracking, and extensive annotations, using the movie   Forrest Gump   as a rich, multimodal stimulus (  studyforrest.org  ; Hanke et al.,  ,  ,  ). Although studies of participants freely viewing films or navigating virtual environments have been used since the early days of fMRI, the naturalistic studies represent a small portion of the overall task-based fMRI literature (Beauregard et al.,  ; Burgess et al.,  ; Maguire,  ). Despite offering advantages, the growing body of naturalistic fMRI research has yet to be quantitatively assessed, and little is known of how the neural bases of these tasks support complex information processing and behavioral demands. 

Here, we applied an unbiased, data-driven, meta-analytic approach to quantitatively explore and classify knowledge embedded in the naturalistic fMRI literature. Using an approach developed by Laird et al. ( ), we capitalized on the wealth and flexibility of published naturalistic paradigms and investigated recurrent patterns of brain activation reported across a wide variety of tasks and behaviors of interest. This method is based on the premise that functionally similar tasks engage spatially similar patterns of brain activity and that by clustering activation patterns from experimental contrasts, similar experimental paradigms can be identified. Naturalistic paradigms are uniquely rich here because of the multitude of component processes contributing to realistic behavior that can be illuminated by modeling strategies in data analysis. To this end, we extracted relevant information about the stimuli and task demands of these paradigms and assessed motifs in the arrangement of this information, with respect the data-driven clustering analysis, to determine which paradigm aspects elicited activation patterns that subserve common and dissociable cognitive processes. Although naturalistic paradigms vary greatly and are designed to probe a wide range of psychological constructs and behaviors, we hypothesized that complex, multisensory processing are associated with a set of core neural networks engaged by similar content domains and task demands. The objectives of this study were to first elucidate core brain networks engaged by the myriad processes that underlie behavior during naturalistic fMRI paradigms and then to characterize how information processing is potentially distributed between these networks to facilitate complex behaviors in realistic settings. 


## METHODS 
  
### Naturalistic fMRI Paradigms 
  
Here, “naturalistic” paradigms were operationally defined as tasks employing any stimulus that demanded continuous, real-time integration of dynamic streams of information. This definition excludes any paradigms based on still-frame stimulus presentation, which intrinsically impose static constraints that are rarely present in the world and, thus, limit ecologically their validity. Importantly, a key distinction of naturalistic tasks is that stimuli are continuously presented across the duration of the task, whereas other tasks in the literature rely on repeated trials of stimuli. As real-world behavior contextually involves all sensory modalities, we included naturalistic tasks in which such stimuli were presented via the visual, auditory, or tactile modalities or any combination thereof. Visual naturalistic tasks require either a real-time interaction with visual stimuli, in the case of video games and virtual reality, or the continuous integration of real-time information, such as during film viewing. Auditory tasks, including the perception of music and spoken stories, similarly require the continuous integration of, and often interaction with, real-time information. Our operational definition also included tactile naturalistic paradigms, which involve the manipulation and recognition of physical objects. During these tactile tasks, participants gather and integrate sensory information to create a mental representation of the object and, if necessary, form an appropriate behavioral response. Lastly, we note the inclusion of multisensory tasks. As in life, many naturalistic experiments simultaneously present auditory, visual, and tactile information, and such tasks demand the real-time integration of information from multiple sensory modalities. 


### Literature Search, Filtering, and Annotation 
  
An extensive literature search was performed to amass a corpus of naturalistic fMRI studies that were published since the emergence of fMRI in 1992. To identify published naturalistic fMRI studies, PubMed searches were carried out by focusing on stimulus types common to naturalistic research (e.g., video games, film, virtual reality). The first search string, performed on January 13, 2016, used the following string to identify relevant studies by their titles and abstracts: ((“naturalistic”[Title/Abstract] OR “real-world”[Title/Abstract] OR “ecologically valid”[Title/Abstract] OR “true-to-life”[Title/Abstract] OR “realistic”[Title/Abstract] OR “video game”[Title/Abstract] OR “film”[Title/Abstract] OR “movie”[Title/Abstract] OR “virtual reality”[Title/Abstract]) AND (“fMRI”[Title/Abstract] OR “functional magnetic resonance imaging”[Title/Abstract]) AND (“Humans”[MeSH])). This search yielded 679 studies (January 2016), some of which utilized stimulus types that we had not included in our initial query, including music, speech, and tactile objects. To identify any studies using these tasks that may not have been returned by the initial query, a second search was performed on January 20, 2016, using the string ((“music”[Title/Abstract] OR “speech”[Title/Abstract] OR “spoken”[Title/Abstract] OR “tactile object”[Title/Abstract]) AND (“naturalistic”[Title/Abstract] OR “real-world”[Title/Abstract] OR “ecologically valid”[Title/Abstract] OR “true-to-life”[Title/Abstract] OR “realistic”[Title/Abstract]) AND (“fMRI”[Title/Abstract] OR “functional magnetic resonance imaging”[Title/Abstract]) AND “Humans”[MeSH]). This secondary search returned 48 studies, some of which were included in the results of the first search. The two sets of search results were pooled to identify 754 unique studies, which were then reviewed and filtered to identify studies utilizing naturalistic paradigms as defined above. 

Each of 754 candidate studies was first screened and then reviewed according to the following exclusion criteria ( ; Moher, Liberati, Tetzlaff, Altman, & Altman,  ). The screening process examined the Abstracts and Methods of each paper to exclude nonnaturalistic tasks in which static, timed blocks of stimuli were presented with a well-defined window for participant response. In this step, we also excluded studies that assessed training or learning across multiple trials or across some period of practice (e.g., pre- vs. post contrasts), as our focus was on neural underpinnings of the tasks themselves and not training-induced changes thereof. In determining eligibility of each paper, studies of participants under the age of 18 or of participants with any history of neurological or psychiatric diagnosis were excluded. After this study-level examination, we then inspected each reported experimental contrast within each paper. In this context, “experiment” represents each statistical parametric image presented, as the result of some functional image data analysis, such as contrasting experimental conditions (Fox et al.,  ). Experiments from analyses that used an a priori region(s) of interest to investigate activation or functional connectivity were omitted permitting identification of whole-brain neural networks. We also excluded contrasts modeling ANOVA interaction-specific activations because of the inherent complexity of such effects. In this step, any studies/contrasts that did not meet the minimum requirements for coordinate-based meta-analysis, reporting the brain activation locations in a three-dimensional, standardized coordinate space, were discarded. 
  
 of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Each of the experiments returned by the PubMed queries were screened according to this schematic. 
  
During inspection of each contrast, one study associate (KLB) manually annotated each experiment with terms that described the experimental design with respect to stimulus type utilized, sensory modality engaged, and the task nature. These terms described the salient aspects of the stimuli and behaviors associated with each individual experimental contrast from the corpus of naturalistic paradigms, annotating the particular aspects of the tasks highlighted by each modeled experimental contrast, and not the intended psychological construct interrogated by the original report. These manual annotations were then independently reviewed and confirmed by a second study associate (JSF) to assure consistency and accuracy. Any disagreements or inconsistencies between KLB and JSF were resolved following a final conversation between the two associates. 


### Experimental Design and Statistical Analysis 
  
#### . 
  
Following the identification of relevant papers and experiments/contrasts, reported brain activation coordinates were extracted. All Talairach atlas-based coordinates (Talairach & Tournoux,  ) were converted to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space (Collins et al.,  ; Evans et al.,  ) using the tal2icbm transformation (Lancaster et al.,  ; Laird et al.,  ). Probabilistic modeled activation (MA) maps were created from the foci reported in each individual contrast by modeling a spherical Gaussian blur around each focus, with full width at half maximum determined by the number of subjects in each experiment in order to represent the uncertainty induced by the inherent variability from individual differences and between-lab differences (Eickhoff et al.,  ). These MA maps were concatenated into an array of   n   experiments by   p   voxels, which was then analyzed for pairwise correlations that reflected the degree of spatial similarity between the MA maps from each of the   n   experiments and those of every other experiment. The resultant   n   ×   n   correlation matrix represented the similarity of spatial topography of MA maps between every possible pair of experiments. 


####  analysis. 
  
Individual naturalistic experiments (  n   MA maps) were then classified into   K   groups based on their spatial topography similarities. The   k  -means clustering procedure was performed in Matlab (Mathworks, R2013b for Linux), which grouped experiments by pairwise similarity, calculating correlation distance by 1 minus the correlation between MA maps (from the aforementioned correlation matrix) and finding the “best” grouping by minimizing the sum of correlation distances within each cluster (code available at   https://github.com/62442katieb/meta-analytic-kmeans  ). This approach begins by choosing   K   arbitrary maps as representative centroids for each of the   K   clusters and assigning experiments to each cluster based on the closest (most similar) centroid. This process continued iteratively until a stable solution was reached. 

Solutions were investigated for a range of   K   = 2–10 clusters. Once the clustering analysis was complete for all   K  , we compared each solution with the neighboring solutions and assessed for improvement across parcellation schemes by using four metrics describing cluster separation and stability (Bzdok et al.,  ; Eickhoff et al.,  ). This allowed us to objectively select the number of clusters that most optimally divided the dataset. The first metric,   average cluster silhouette   across clustering solutions, assessed the separation between clusters and described whether clusters were distinct or overlapping. A higher silhouette value indicates that greater separation is ideal and that each experiment fits well into its cluster, with lower misclassification likelihood of fringe experiments into neighboring clusters. Stability is indicated by a relatively minimal change in silhouette from one solution (  K  ) to the next (  K   + 1), indicated by the positive derivative of the silhouette score closest to zero, with greatest stability evidenced by the smallest change between two points. Second, we considered the   consistency of experiment assignment   by comparing the ratio of the minimum number of experiments consistently assigned to a cluster relative to the mean number of experiments consistently assigned to that cluster. In this case, only ratios above 0.5, in which at least half of the experiments were consistently assigned, were considered viable solutions. Third, the   variation of information   was quantified, which compared the entropy of clusters with the mutual information shared between them for each solution   K   and its   K   − 1 and   K   + 1 neighbors. A large decrease in variation of information from   K   − 1 to   K   and increase from   K   to   K   + 1, a local minimum in the plot of variation of information across   K  , indicated a decrease in overlap between solutions and, thus, stability of solution   K  . In this case, “large” is defined, too, in relative terms, with the largest decrease indicating greatest stability of the solutions considered. Finally, we computed a   hierarchy index   for each solution, which assessed how clusters split from the   K   − 1 to   K   solution to form the additional cluster. A lower hierarchy index indicated that clusters present in   K   stemmed from fewer of the clusters present in   K   − 1, another indication of stability in groupings demonstrated by a local minimum across values of   K  . An optimal clustering solution is one that demonstrated minimal overlap between clusters (i.e., high silhouette value), while exhibiting relative stability in comparison with the previous and next solutions (i.e., consistency > 0.5, a local minimum in variation of information, and lower hierarchy index than previous).

From the identified optimal clustering solution, we probed the underlying neural topography associated with each of the   K   groups of experiments (Laird et al.,  ). To this end, the   meta-analysis algorithm (Turkeltaub et al.,  ; Laird et al.,  ) was applied to generate a map of convergent activation for each grouping of experiments with similar topography. The ALE algorithm includes a weighting of the number of subjects when computing these maps of convergent activation and accounts for uncertainty associated with individual, template, and registration differences between and across experiments (Eickhoff et al.,  ; Turkeltaub et al.,  ). The union of these probability distributions was used to calculate ALE scores, a quantitative assessment of convergence between brain activation across different experiments, which was compared against 1,000 permutations of a null distribution of random spatial arrangements (Eickhoff et al.,  ). These ALE values for each meta-analytic grouping of experiments were thresholded at   p   < 0.01 (cluster-level corrected for family-wise error) with a voxel-level, cluster-forming threshold of   p   < 0.001 (Eickhoff et al.,  ; Woo et al.,  ). The resultant ALE maps thus reflected the convergent activation patterns within each of the   K   clusters. The experimental   K   clusters are hereafter referred to as  , representing meta-analytic groups of experiments demonstrating similar activation patterns. 



### 
  
Once we elucidated convergent activation patterns within MAGs, we sought to gain insight into what aspects of the naturalistic paradigms were most frequently associated with each MAG via functional decoding. Functional decoding is a quantitative, data-driven method by which researchers can infer which mental processes are related to activation in a specific brain region (or set of brain regions) across published fMRI studies. We chose to use two complementary functional decoding approaches, one based on our study-specific, subjective manual annotations mentioned above, and another based on the objective, automated annotations provided by the Neurosynth database for over 11,000 functional neuroimaging studies (Yarkoni et al.,  ;   Neurosynth.org  ). First, the manually annotated terms associated with each experiment were grouped into the MAGs identified above and were assessed by frequency of occurrence in each MAG. The distribution of stimulus modality, stimulus type, and salient terms across MAGs allowed us to evaluate the relationship between activation patterns and the aspects of naturalistic paradigms that elicited them. Second, we included an automated, data-driven annotation method using Neurosynth, which includes automatically extracted terms that occur at a high frequency in the abstract of each archived study. To functionally decode our MAGs, we compared the MAGs’ activation patterns with those reported across published neuroimaging papers in the Neurosynth database. To this end, we uploaded each ALE map to NeuroVault, a web-based repository for 3D statistical neuroimaging maps that directly interfaces with Neurosynth (Gorgolewski et al.,  ;   NeuroVault.org  ). NeuroVault enables “functional decoding” by correlating unthresholded uploaded maps with term-specific meta-analytic maps extracted from Neurosynth’s database of published functional neuroimaging studies. The Neurosynth functional decoding results were exported as a set of terms and correlation values representing how well the spatial distribution of activation associated with each term in the database matched the activation pattern of the uploaded map. 

Both sets of terms (i.e., obtained via manual and automated approaches) were evaluated to assess the specific aspects of naturalistic paradigms associated with each MAG. The Neurosynth terms representing broad behavioral aspects across fMRI studies that elicit similar brain activation profiles provides both an unbiased description of the experiments engaging each MAG, as well as a comparison of our corpus of studies with the broader literature. On the other hand, manual annotation provides a more concise, accurate description of the paradigms, although it is predisposed to the subjective bias of human annotation. The results of this two-pronged functional decoding approach were designed to describe the processes that engage brain networks similar to each MAG and how these processes may be similar or different in naturalistic fMRI studies compared with the broader functional neuroimaging literature. The distribution of stimulus modalities and types across MAGs was assessed, too. Together, the functional decoding results and distributions of different stimuli were interpreted to provide insight into how information processing is functionally segregated across cooperating neural systems during naturalistic tasks. 



## RESULTS 
  
The literature search yielded a combined set of 110 studies that reported coordinates of brain activation from naturalistic fMRI tasks among healthy adults ( ; PubMed IDs available in Supporting Information Table S1, Bottenhorn, Flannery, Boeving, Riedel, Eickhoff, Sutherland, & Laird,  ). The final dataset included activation foci from 376 experimental contrasts (  N   = 1,817 subjects) derived from tasks using a variety of stimulus types and sensory modalities. Across our corpus of naturalistic fMRI experiments, approximately 55% assessed a single stimulus modality, including 40% visual stimuli, 13% auditory, and 1% tactile. 

Conversely, 45% of experiments utilized multisensory stimuli, including 41% that employed audiovisual stimuli, 2% in which a visual stimulus was paired with painful, tactile stimuli, and 1% pairing visual and nonpainful tactile stimuli ( ). Of the visual experiments, 69% involved a motor response, as did 25% of the audiovisual experiments, ranging from a button press to joystick and object manipulation. The stimulus types most frequently used across the included experiments were films (45%), virtual reality (32%), speech (9%), and music (6%) ( ).

###  k  -Means Clustering Solutions 
  
MA maps were created for each contrast and then clustered to identify groups with similar activation topographies. For completeness, the   k  -means clustering solutions for   K   = 2–10 clusters were quantitatively evaluated across four metrics to identify an optimal solution ( ). When considering the average silhouette metric ( ), values generally increased as   K   increased and the   smallest increase   was observed between   K   = 6 to   K   = 7, indicating little additional separation between clusters gained by moving from 6 to 7 clusters. With respect to the consistency of assigned experiments metric ( ), each of the solutions   K   = 2–10 met the stability requirement whereby the minimum number of experiments included in any iteration of the solution was at least 50% of the mean number of experiments included across iterations. The variation of information metric ( ), suggested the stability of a 6-cluster solution as parameter value   decreases   were observed when moving from   K   = 5 to   K   = 6, combined with parameter   increases   when moving from   K   = 6 to   K   = 7, indicating that a 6-cluster solution demonstrates relative stability. The hierarchy index metric ( ) further corroborated a 6-cluster solution, as a local minimum as observed at   K   = 6. Because of agreement across these metrics, we chose to proceed with the   K   = 6 solution. 
  
Metrics computed for   K   = 2–10 clustering solutions. (A) The average cluster silhouette for each solution   K   from 2 to 10 clusters, showing the distribution of average silhouette values at each value of   K  , resampled 100 times leaving one random experiment out each time. (B) Consistency in experiments assignment to clusters, plotting the minimum consistently assigned clusters next to the mean of consistently assigned clusters. (C) The change in variation of information, a distance metric, from the   K   − 1 to   K   and from   K   to   K   + 1. (D) The hierarchy index for each of   K   clustering solutions, which provides information about how clusters in the   K   solution stemmed from clusters in the   K   − 1 solution. 
  

### Meta-Analytic Groupings 
  
The optimal clustering solution yielded six MAGs of experiments in our corpus, suggesting similarities in brain activation across this sample of the naturalistic literature coalesce into six distinct patterns. The number of experiments that were clustered into each MAG ranged from 50 to 83 experiments (mean = 62.67;   SD   = 12.46). ALE maps of the six MAGs were generated and demonstrated little overlap in activation patterns, suggesting distinct patterns of recurrent activation across our set of naturalistic experiments ( ; Supporting Information Table S2, Bottenhorn et al.,  ). Whereas some of the MAGs exhibited focal patterns of convergent activation, restricted to a single or neighboring gyri (e.g., MAG 1 and 5), others presented with distributed convergence across multiple lobes (e.g., MAG 2 and 6). Most of the resulting MAGs were restricted to cortical activation patterns, although MAG 3 exhibited convergent activation in subcortical and brainstem regions (results available on NeuroVault at   https://neurovault.org/collections/3179/  ). 
  
Convergent activation patterns of MAGs from the naturalistic corpus. ALE meta-analysis of experiments in each MAG yielded six patterns of convergent activation. 
  
MAG 1 included convergent activation in the bilateral posterior temporal areas, including portions of the inferior, middle, and superior temporal gyri, extending into the inferior parietal lobule and into the middle occipital gyrus, as well as in the left supramarginal gyrus, right precentral and middle frontal gyri, and in the bilateral precuneus. MAG 2 exhibited convergence in left inferior frontal gyrus, left precentral gyrus, anterior and posterior aspects of the middle temporal gyrus, precuneus, in addition to both the left and right superior frontal gyri. MAG 3 demonstrated a largely symmetric convergence pattern across multiple subcortical structures including bilateral amygdalae, putamen, thalamus, parahippocampal gyrus, and periaqueductal gray, with cortical clusters observed in the left inferior frontal sulcus and inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral anterior cingulate cortex, and bilateral fusiform gyri. MAG 4 exhibited convergent activation in bilateral medial temporal lobes, parahippocampal regions, bilateral precuneus, retrospenial posterior cingulate cortex, occipital regions including the lingual gyrus, right calcarine sulcus, and cuneus, in addition to a small, bilateral portion of the middle frontal gyri. MAG 5 showed convergence in the bilateral superior temporal gyri. MAG 6 demonstrated convergence in the bilateral superior frontal sulci, intraparietal sulci, and superior parietal lobules as well as convergence in higher order visual processing areas in the middle occipital and lingual gyri. 


### Stimulus Distribution Across MAGs 
  
Each stimulus modality was represented in multiple MAGs, but modalities were not evenly distributed across MAGs ( ). Experiments utilizing audiovisual tasks were somewhat uniformly distributed across the MAGs, with a slightly higher proportion of audiovisual tasks in MAGs 1, 3, and 5. In contrast, more than half of the experiments using auditory tasks were grouped into MAGs 2 and 6. Notably, more experiments based on auditory and audiovisual stimuli were clustered into MAG 5 than any other MAG. Experiments in which participants experienced physical pain were not present in MAGs 1, 5, and 6, but distributed nearly evenly among MAGs 2 through 4, with a slightly higher portion in MAG 3. More than half of experiments that used tactile stimuli were grouped into MAG 5 and 6. Visual experiments were more evenly distributed across clusters, although there was a markedly smaller proportion in MAG 5 than any other MAG. One stimulus type, “sounds,” was represented only once across the corpus and was, thus, excluded from  . The complete distribution of stimulus modalities across MAGs is provided in Supporting Information Table S3 (Bottenhorn et al.,  ).

(B) The proportion of each stimulus type present within the corpus that is associated with each MAG. These percentages represent the proportion modality or stimulus type present in each MAG, compared with the total count of that modality or stimulus type across all MAGs. 
  
As with stimulus modality, most stimulus types showed unequal, but not necessarily selective, distribution across MAGs ( ). Film-based experiments were uniformly distributed across MAGs, and tasks utilizing spoken stimuli were more frequently grouped into MAGs 2 and 5. Again, auditory stimuli were highly associated with MAG 5, as more than 50% of music experiments and 20% of speech experiments were clustered into MAG 5. Experiments that required subjects to play video games were most often grouped into MAGs 4 and 6. Experimental contrasts, which included a condition in which participants received tactile stimulation or manipulated tactile objects, were most prevalent in MAGs 3 and 6. A detailed distribution of stimulus types across MAGs is shown in Supporting Information Table S4 (Bottenhorn et al.,  ). 


### Functional Decoding 
  
Two approaches for functionally decoding each MAG, manual and automated annotations, were performed to develop a functional interpretation of each MAG’s association with aspects of naturalistic paradigms. 

#### Manual annotations. 
  
Our manual annotations utilized a list of 26 corpus-specific metadata terms, which captured salient features of the naturalistic design, rather than the psychological constructs assumed to be involved.   displays each of these terms and their frequency of occurrence across MAGs and across the entire corpus (Column = “Total”), highlighting which terms described the largest number of experiments (e.g., “  navigation  ,” “  visual features  ,” “  emotional film  ,” “  attention  ”), as well as those that accounted for a minimal number of experiments (e.g., “  violence  ,” “  tactile  ,” “  pain  ”). Values in   indicate the percent of experiments labeled with each term, or the base rate of each term throughout the dataset, keeping in mind that each experiment was labeled with only one or two terms. Once the experiments were clustered into six MAGs, we evaluated the relative contributions of each term per MAG, controlling for base rate by dividing each term’s per-MAG count by that term’s total count across the corpus ( ). We assessed, too, the ability of each term to predict whether an experiment labeled with that term will be clustered into each MAG, (P(MAG|term)) or “forward inference,” and the ability of belongingness to each MAG to predict whether an experiment will be labeled with a particular term, (P(term|MAG)) or “reverse inference.” These outcomes provide the association of each term with each MAG ( ). Some of the terms in the manual annotation analysis corresponded to stimulus types in   (e.g., per-MAG distribution for “  music  ” and “  video game  ”). However, many of the manually derived terms highlighted experimental aspects that reflect the unique and salient features of the naturalistic corpus (e.g., “  anthropomorphic  ,” “  violence  ”) and are not included in standard neuroimaging paradigm ontologies such as BrainMap (Fox et al.,  ) or CogPO (Turner & Laird,  ).

#### Automated Neurosynth annotations. 
  
To complement the manual annotation analysis, we used Neurosynth’s automated annotations, which describes experiments that engage each MAG based on published neuroimaging data, allowing comparison of our corpus with the broader literature. MAG results were decoded in Neurosynth, yielding correlation values indicating the similarity of the input map (i.e., each MAG’s ALE map) and maps associated with each term from the Neurosynth database. To facilitate interpretation, the top 10 terms with the highest correlation values for each MAG are presented ( ). Terms that were near-duplicates of terms already included in the list were removed, such as “  emotion  ” and “  emotions  ” if “  emotional  ” was higher on the list. Noncontent terms (e.g., “  abstract  ,” “  reliable  ”) and terms that described brain regions, such as “  insula  ” or “  mt  ,” were also excluded.

#### Functional interpretation of MAGs. 
  
The combined knowledge gained from the MAGs topography, as well as the manual and automated metadata decoding analyses, provided insight into the functional interpretation of the clustering results. Overall, the terms yielded by Neurosynth decoding generally agreed with the manual annotation terms in characterizing the MAGs. Below is a summary of the six MAGs; note that reported labels do not refer to the definitive function of these regions, but rather indicate how each MAG reflects differential network contributions during naturalistic fMRI paradigms. 

Manual annotations indicated that MAG 1 experiments involved attention and the processing of dynamic visual features, in addition to visually presented anthropomorphic forms and faces. Most of the stimuli in these experiments were films ( ), especially affective films. Neurosynth results largely converged with these manual annotations, as terms including “  videos  ,” “  body  ”, “  observation  ,” and “  visual motion  ” ( ) were associated with activations in MAG 1 regions. These annotations, together with the presence of convergent activation across regions commonly associated with higher level visual processing, suggest that MAG 1 was associated with the observation of body and biological motion ( ). 

Manual annotations indicated that MAG 2 experiments involved language processing, inference, and judgments about congruence. This MAG included relatively large proportions of the experiments using speech, video games, and tactile stimulation ( ). Neurosynth results supported the manual annotations’ indication that this MAG was associated with language processing and comprehension, as terms such as “  sentence  ,” “  comprehension  ,” “  semantic  ,” and “  mentalizing  ” ( ) were returned. These annotations and the presence of convergent activation in predominately left lateralized regions typically associated with higher order cognition and language suggest that MAG 2 related to language processing ( ). 

Manual annotations indicated that MAG 3 experiments involved human interactions or affective displays, including emotional and erotic films. Films were the predominantly used stimuli across these experiments, while most paradigms using painful stimuli were grouped into this MAG ( ). Neurosynth results corroborated these manual annotation interpretations regarding affective, aversive, and social processing, with terms such as “  emotion  ,” “  facial expressions  ,” “  fearful  ,” and “  affective  ” ( ). Together, these annotations and a convergent activation pattern involving bilateral amygdalae suggest that MAG 3 was associated with emotional processing ( ). 

Manual annotations indicated that MAG 4 heavily represented experiments involving navigation through virtual reality environments, with spatial memory demands related to encoding unfamiliar virtual landscapes for future use. A few of these experiments required language processing as well, and half of the experiments that used 3D images were grouped into MAG 5 ( ). The manual annotations were reflected in the Neurosynth results, as similar patterns of activation have been associated with “  navigation  ,” “  scenes  ,” “  memory  ,” and “  place  .” Additional related terms added depth to our characterization, expanding on the memory demands with “  retrieval  ,” “  episodic memory  ,” and “  remembering  ” ( ). Overall, these experimental characteristics and convergent activation in medial temporal regions and along the visual processing stream suggest that MAG 5 was associated with navigation and spatial memory ( ). 

Manual annotations showed that MAG 5 experiments primarily involved either film or music stimuli ( ) and engaged either audiovisual or purely auditory processing ( ). More than half of the included experiments that used music as stimuli were grouped into this MAG ( ), with some stimuli involving an emotional quality ( ). Neurosynth corroborated these interpretations returning terms such as “  auditory  ,” “  sounds  ,” “  listening  ,” and “  speech  ” associated with activation of the regions in this MAG. These metadata descriptions combined with convergent activation in superior temporal regions suggest this MAG’s association with auditory processing ( ). 

Manual annotations of MAG 6 experiments implicated tasks involving visual attentional demands and the processing of visual features, as participants engaged in video games, tactile stimulation, and virtual reality navigation ( ,  ). Stimuli with high visuospatial demands (i.e., video games, virtual reality, and pictures) were represented more by this MAG than any other, whereas stimuli with low visuospatial demands (i.e., music and speech) were represented the least in this MAG. Some experiments involved memory encoding, and visual processing. Neurosynth supported this characterization returning terms including “  visual  ,” “  attention  ,” “  eye movements  ,” “  saccades  ,” and “  spatial attention  ” associated with activation of the regions in this MAG ( ). These annotations and convergent activation in regions resembling the dorsal attention network and areas of higher level visual processing (e.g., superior frontal and parietal regions, extrastriate cortex) suggest this MAG’s association with visuospatial attention ( ). 




## DISCUSSION 
  
To characterize a core set of brain networks engaged in more ecologically valid neuroimaging designs, we employed a data-driven approach that meta-analytically grouped published naturalistic fMRI results according to their spatial topographies. Objective metrics suggested that a solution of   K   = 6 clusters provided the most stable and disparate grouping of experiments across the naturalistic fMRI literature, and ALE meta-analysis delineated convergent activation across spatially distinct brain regions for each meta-analytic grouping (MAG) of experiments. We then considered how such networks subdivide information processing by assessing the characteristics of the constituent experiments from each MAG. Utilizing both manual and automated functional decoding approaches, enhanced interpretations of the mental processes associated with specific constellations of brain regions were gleaned such that the outcomes of the two approaches generally agreed, with differences highlighting domain-specific and domain-general processes associated with naturalistic paradigms. 

### Distributed Processing for Complex Functions 
  
Although the six identified MAGs are spatially distinct and appear to correspond with dissociable mental processes, most of the included naturalistic tasks that reported more than one statistical contrast recruited more than one MAG (66 of 86). This is consistent with functional segregation and the flexible nature of the naturalistic design, demonstrating that the manipulation of different contrasts can identify distinct networks that likely cooperate to successfully perform a complex task. Further indicative of coordinated interactions and distributed processing, each MAG included experiments that utilized different task modalities and task types. Overwhelmingly, the identified MAGs and the functional characterizations thereof support the notion that complex behaviors are facilitated by coordinated interactions between several large-scale sensory, attentional, and domain-specific networks, a position increasingly endorsed in neuroimaging endeavors (Barrett & Satpute,  ; Lindquist et al.,  ; Mišić & Sporns,  ; Spreng et al.,  ). The characterization of identified MAGs from aspects of the naturalistic paradigms that elicit them suggest an information processing model of cooperating systems ( ) for sensory input (MAGs 1 and 5), attentional control (MAG 6), and domain-specific processing (MAGs 2, 3, and 4), into and from which information is segregated and integrated to enable complex behaviors (e.g., language, emotion, spatial navigation). Output relevant to the corresponding input would be relegated by motor planning and execution systems, which are notably absent from the characterization of MAGs presented here, as experiments requiring a motor response were evenly distributed across MAGs, rather than clustered together. 
  
Complex systems for dynamical information processing. The identified MAGs present a framework of component systems that interact to enable complex information processing needed for naturalistic behavior, including necessary input systems, as well as systems for modality-specific (indicated by dashed line) visuospatial attentional gating of irrelevant information and domain-specific processing for language-, emotion-, and navigation-related tasks. 
  
MAGs 1 and 5 primarily represent the perceptual processing streams of incoming auditory and visual information, and likely cooperate to process audiovisual information. Functional decoding suggests that MAG 1 is involved in viewing faces and anthropomorphic figures, which is consistent with previous research showing that posterior temporal and temporo-occipital regions corresponding with area V5/MT are associated with the perception of movement, specifically biological movement (Cohen Kadosh et al.,  ; Pelphrey et al.,  ,  ; Puce et al.,  ; Wheaton et al.,  ). Similarly, MAG 5 is associated with listening to music and speech, as well as perceiving pitch and tone, stretching across primary auditory cortex and into regions of higher auditory processing (Gray et al.,  ; Türe et al.,  ). Per functional decoding of MAG 6 of both manual and automated annotations, MAG 6 is associated with visuospatial attention. This functional characterization is also supported by corresponding fronto-parietal activations that are often associated with attending to visual stimuli (Braga et al.,  ; Puschmann et al.,  ). MAGs 1 and 5 represent the perceptual processing streams of audiovisual information. 

Information processing depends on input from perceptual systems, filtered by attentional gating, but proceeds in a functionally segregated manner, seen in domain-specific MAGs for linguistic, emotional, and spatial processing. When considering language processing, there is necessary input to primary auditory areas (MAG 5) that is further processed by higher level language areas that facilitate speech perception and comprehension (MAG 2). More than a third of contrasts from experiments that utilized speech-based paradigms contributed to the convergent activation pattern of MAG 2, which was linked by both functional decoding techniques to language-related processes. Furthermore, the regions of MAG 2 resemble a neural “language network” (Friederici & Gierhan,  ; Heim et al.,  ; Price,  ; Saur et al.,  ), including some regions associated with orofacial articulation (lip, tongue, and jaw movements) and motor planning (SMA, pre-SMA) that allow the motor components of speech. By presenting language in a context that is more representative of how we process language in everyday life, such as through the use of spoken fictional narratives (AbdulSabur et al.,  ; Wallentin et al.,  ; Xu et al.,  ) or scene descriptions (Summerfield et al.,  ), naturalistic fMRI paradigms allow researchers to explore the multiple neural networks at work in performing the cooperating processes that facilitate language processing. Similarly, emotional processing (MAG 3) often necessitates audiovisual input (MAGs 1 and 5) and necessitates attention (MAG 6). Emotional films recruited regions across these four MAGs, suggesting a similarly diverse group of coordinated neural systems are engaged when observing affective displays. Additionally, navigation (Burgess et al.,  ; Kalpouzos et al.,  ; Wolbers et al.,  ) depends on visual input (MAG 1), effective visuospatial attentional (MAG 6), and spatial memory and processing (MAG 4). The functional characterization of MAG 4 from manual and Neurosynth decoding highlights its involvement in navigation and spatial memory, supported by studies of rats and humans with brain lesions that indicate the importance of medial temporal, hippocampal, and precuneus regions in processing visual scenes and spatial information (Bird & Burgess,  ; Epstein,  ; Lee et al.,  ; Sailer et al.,  ; Squire et al.,  ; Summerfield et al.,  ; Xu et al.,  ). 

Finally, the characterization of MAG 6 indicates a domain-specific attentional system, as both manual and automated Neurosynth decoding highlight its involvement in visual processing in the absence of any association with other modalities. This is reflected by the distributions of stimuli across MAGs ( ), which show low numbers of auditory and pain-related stimuli represented in MAG 6, while rich visual stimuli that include spatial information (i.e., video games, virtual reality, and pictures) are highly represented across the experiments in MAG 6. Curiously, tactile object manipulation was highly represented in MAG 6, representing the perception of spatial information in the absence of visual information ( ,  ). Together, these suggest that MAG 6 provides modality-specific attentional gating, depicted by the dashed line in  . 


### Limitations 
  
The present results may be limited by the   k  -means clustering method, which is limited by the assumptions of the algorithm and underlying topology of the data, as it is sensitive to spherical clusters and assumes the data are linearly separable. Furthermore, there is a potential for bias with this method; certain parameters are specified by the researcher beforehand. To address this potential for bias and the stability of our clustering solution, we performed duplicate clustering analyses with both linear (hierarchical clustering using Ward’s method) and nonlinear (kernel   k  -means and density-based spatial clustering) methods. The results of these analyses are provided in the Supporting information (Figures S1–S3, Bottenhorn et al.,  ) and confirmed that our choice of the   k  -means clustering method provided optimal separation of the data into six clusters. Experiments in our corpus were grouped using the   kmeans++   algorithm for each of   K   = 2 through   K   = 20 solutions, repeated 1,000 times to ensure that each solution minimized the point-to-centroid distance, indicative of optimal clustering (Kanungo et al.,  ). Pearson’s correlation was selected as the distance metric, as recommended by Laird et al. ( ). The   K   = 6 solution was designated as an optimal candidate solution before assessing the convergent activation patterns of each MAG, based on the aforementioned metrics, yielding a data-driven result. These results are, of course, influenced by the choice of clustering method, and should be considered accordingly. As this was a meta-analytic effort, it is limited, too, by the initial modeling of the data. Despite this, coordinate-based meta-analyses are considered a robust method for synthesis of previously published functional neuroimaging literature (Eickhoff et al.,  ,  ; Fox et al.,  ). Although the functional decoding-based manual annotations relied on a subjective process, the results were largely confirmed by comparison with the wider body of functional neuroimaging literature facilitated by Neurosynth’s automated functional decoding. It is worth noting that the naturalistic literature is somewhat limited, with an emphasis on navigation and affective processing, and continued research and expansion of this corpus will facilitate development of a more comprehensive model of the neural networks that support realistic behavior. 


### Summary and Future Work 
  
In summary, this meta-analysis of naturalistic fMRI studies that apply dynamic, lifelike tasks to explore the neural correlates of behavior has shown that these paradigms engage a set of core neural networks, supporting both separate processing of different streams of information and the integration of related information to enable flexible cognition and complex behavior. We identified seven patterns of consistent activation that correspond with neural networks that are involved in sensory input, top-down attentional control, domain-specific processing, and motor planning, representing the set of behavioral processes elicited by naturalistic paradigms in our corpus. Across the corpus, tasks provided mainly visual and auditory sensory input that engaged regions across MAGs 1 and 5, while MAG 6 appeared to contribute to top-down attentional control to filter out nonessential visual and/or spatial information. Salient information can be processed by the relevant domain-specific networks, shown in MAGs 2 (language), 3 (emotion), and 4 (navigation and spatial memory), informing the appropriate response. Most naturalistic tasks engaged multiple networks to process the relevant information from a stimulus and generate an appropriate response. A shift in favor of utilizing naturalistic paradigms, when possible, would greatly benefit the field, as naturalistic stimuli more closely approximate the full complement of processing necessary for realistic behavior. Because of the availability of naturalistic fMRI data from sources such as studyforrest.org, the Human Connectome Project, and the Healthy Brain Network Serial Scanning Initiative (HBNSSI), an intriguing next step in this line of work would include validating these MAGs in the primary analysis of imaging data. Exploring how multifaceted processes interact and, ultimately, contribute to behavior will allow us to better understand the brain and human behavior in the real world. In the future, studies of this sort would greatly benefit from an automated annotation process for an objective functional decoding of included papers, instead of subjective manual annotation.

## Introduction 
  
Numerous studies have reported brain alterations in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). However, they pointed to inconsistent findings. 


## Methods 
  
We used a meta‐analytic approach to identify the convergent structural and functional brain abnormalities in bvFTD. Following current best‐practice neuroimaging meta‐analysis guidelines, we searched PubMed and Embase databases and performed reference tracking. Then, the coordinates of group comparisons between bvFTD and controls from 73 studies were extracted and tested for convergence using activation likelihood estimation. 


## Results 
  
We identified convergent abnormalities in the anterior cingulate cortices, anterior insula, amygdala, paracingulate, striatum, and hippocampus. Task‐based and resting‐state functional connectivity pointed to the networks that are connected to the obtained consistent regions. Functional decoding analyses suggested associated dysfunction of emotional processing, interoception, reward processing, higher‐order cognitive functions, and olfactory and gustatory perceptions in bvFTD. 


## Discussion 
  
Our findings highlighted the key role of the salience network and subcortical regions in the pathophysiology of bvFTD.

## INTRODUCTION 
  
Behavioral‐variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is a neurodegenerative syndrome characterized by neurodegeneration in the frontal and anterior temporal lobes leading to insidious and progressive changes in behavior, personality, and social functions.  BvFTD is the most common frontotemporal dementia (FTD) syndrome and the second major cause of early‐onset dementia after Alzheimer's disease (AD).  Given the heterogeneous symptomology and gradual course of the disease, early detection of bvFTD is often abstruse and causes frustrating experiences for patients and relatives.  Accordingly, the current bvFTD diagnostic criteria has incorporated neuroimaging findings to improve the accuracy of clinical evaluation, particularly in early stages. 

The most identified structural and functional brain changes in the early stages of bvFTD target a group of interconnected brain regions, so‐called “salience network” (SN), which is associated with social‐emotional processing.  However, individual neuroimaging studies in bvFTD point to divergent findings due to heterogeneous clinical samples, diversity of imaging modalities, flexible analyses, and statistical methods. Thus quantitative assessment of neural abnormalities using neuroimaging meta‐analysis is needed to overcome such divergence in the bvFTD literature. ,   There are a few prior bvFTD neuroimaging meta‐analyses that have indicated atrophy, hypoconnectivity, and hypometabolism in a wide number of brain regions covering the frontomedial cortex, basal ganglia, anterior insula, and the temporal cortex. ,  ,   However, these previous meta‐analyses were mostly unimodal (i.e., using voxel‐based morphometry [VBM] studies only or resting‐state voxel‐based physiology [VBP] studies of fluorodeoxyglucose–positron emission tomography (FDG‐PET) only, or resting‐state fMRI [rs‐fMRI] only), ,  ,   and included a low number of patients, various selection criteria, and often used liberal statistical methods, which increases the opportunity for false‐positive results.  Moreover, previous meta‐analyses have pooled only structural (VBM) studies, highlighting the role of SN in bvFTD.  Thus a multimodal meta‐analysis on task activation, VBM and VBP studies, might provide more information on the pathophysiology of bvFTD. Similar studies have provided comprehensive assessment of disease‐related effects on attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)  and major depressive disorder. 

To elucidate consensus structural and functional regional aberrations in bvFTD, we applied activation likelihood estimation (ALE), the most commonly applied algorithm among the coordinate‐based meta‐analysis (CBMA) methods, which assesses regional convergence between foci obtained from group comparison experiments.  Next, we located brain co‐activation patterns using meta‐analytic connectivity modeling (MACM)  and resting‐state functional connectivity (RSFC)  to reveal networks connected to the meta‐analytically obtained regions in task‐based and resting‐state experiments, respectively. Finally, we performed hierarchical clustering analysis based on the pairwise RSFC profile and functional decoding of the convergent clusters to reveal sub‐networks between convergent regions and assess the mental functions associated with these regions, respectively. We assessed functional characteristics of the identified regions using the BrainMap data set. 


## METHODS AND MATERIALS 
  
The present large‐scale CBMA was performed following the recently developed, best‐practice guidelines for neuroimaging meta‐analyses ,   and adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) statement. ,   The protocol for this study was pre‐registered on International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO, code: CRD42020127902). 

### Search strategy, selection criteria, and quality appraisal 
  
We performed a systematic literature search (up to May 2020) to identify structural and functional neuroimaging studies that compared bvFTD patients with their matched healthy controls (details are reported in the supplement). Studies were included if they (1) included clinically diagnosed bvFTD patients with no concurrent psychiatric diagnosis (e.g., major depressive disorder and bipolar mood disorder), other forms of dementia or neurological symptoms, and no history of alcohol and substance abuse; ,   (2) included at least six participants in either the patient or healthy group; (3) used VBM, fMRI (resting‐state or task based), and FDG‐PET as the imaging modality; (4) reported the coordinates of between‐group contrasts in a defined stochastic space (i.e., Montreal Neurological Institute [MNI] or Talairach); and (5) performed a whole‐brain analysis. Thus, studies using seed‐based functional connectivity (FC), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and cortical thickness methods were all excluded, as suggested previously. ,  

We used a 10‐point checklist developed by Strakowski et al.  and employed by previous meta‐analyses to assess individual study quality based on imaging methodology and clinical and demographic properties of the study. ,  ,   The quality assessment score of included studies are reported in Table  . 


### Activation likelihood estimation analysis 
  
The revised ALE algorithm was used to identify convergent patterns of brain alterations by showing a convergence of reported coordinates across experiments, which is higher than expected under a random spatial association.  The experiments were categorized by their effect direction (increases/decreases) and imaging modalities (see the Supplement for details). Separate ALE meta‐analyses were performed on four subsets of the experiments: (1) pooling all experiments together; (2) experiments reporting decreases in activity/connectivity, metabolism, or gray matter volume (Control > bvFTD); (3) VBM experiments; and (4) combination of functional imaging (FDG‐PET, resting‐state fMRI (rs‐fMRI), task‐based fMRI (t‐fMRI)) experiments. The other sets of experiments, including those categorized based on diagnostic criteria, did not reach the minimum required number for sufficient power (≥17). 
 
#### RESEARCH IN CONTEXT 
  
  
 Systematic Review  : Following the best‐practice guidelines to conduct neuroimaging meta‐analyses, in this large‐scale meta‐analysis we searched PubMed and Embase databases and performed reference tracking to identify convergent regional abnormality across structural and functional neuroimaging studies on behavioral‐variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). 
  
 Interpretation  : Our findings found consistent regional brain abnormality in the salience network and subcortical regions in bvFTD. 
  
 Future Directions  : The future individual and meta‐analysis studies on each specific phenotype of bvFTD are a worthwhile endeavor to understand more about the pathophysiology of bvFTD. 
  

 

### Meta‐analytic connectivity modeling (MACM) and resting‐state functional connectivity (RSFC) 
  
We investigated the task‐based and task‐free functional connectivity profiles of the obtained regions using MACM  and RSFC,  respectively. MACM analysis uses task‐based functional neuroimaging studies to meta‐analytically identify regions that are co‐activated across a range of different tasks with the seed regions, whereas RSFC identifies task‐free FC patterns of the convergent meta‐analytic clusters. A more detailed description of each analysis is available in the Supplement. 


### Hierarchical clustering (HC) and functional decoding (FD) 
  
We performed HC analysis based on the pairwise RSFC profile of the identified regions to reveal the sub‐networks associated with the convergent regions. Finally, we assessed the functional characteristics of the identified regions using the BrainMap data set.  Detailed description of each analysis is available in the Supplement. 



## RESULTS 
  
### Experiments included in the meta‐analysis 
  
After removing duplicate records, we screened a total number of 5045 abstracts and included 73 studies in our meta‐analysis (Figure  , Table  ). The excluded studies and the reasons of exclusion are reported in Table  . Of the 495 studies excluded by full‐text screening from both electronic databases and reference checking, 124 were excluded because the subjects were not bvFTD patients, 97 were excluded because they did not report coordinates significantly different between two groups, and 78 were excluded due to using regions of interest (detailed reasons for exclusion are reported in Figure  ). Among the included papers, 27 studies were performed based on the FRONTIER open data set, and thus their data were merged to minimize within‐group effects.  In addition, eight other studies had partially overlapping samples, and they were pooled together as well. Finally, 31 independent experiments (of 73 studies) comprising 1672 bvFTD patients and 3884 healthy participants were used for ALE analysis. These experiments include VBM (  N   = 20), t‐fMRI (  N   = 1), rs‐fMRI (  N   = 2), or FDG‐PET (  N   = 12). Of note, some experiments used more than one imaging modality; therefore, the collective number of experiments included in each imaging modality exceeds the number of total experiments. A decrease in functional/structural experiments (Controls > bvFTD) was observed more commonly (  N   = 28) and only a few studies (  N   = 3) reported increased functional/structural experiments (bvFTD > Controls).

### Convergent regional abnormalities in bvFTD 
  
First, we assessed consistent structural and functional abnormalities by pooling all experiments (  N   = 31) and identified five convergent clusters in the following regions (  P   < .05, cluster‐level family‐wise error (cFWE)): (i) the right amygdala and hippocampus, (ii) the left caudate and subcallosal cortex, (iii) the bilateral paracingulate gyrus and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), (iv) the bilateral paracingulate gyrus extending to small portions of the medial orbitofrontal cortex, and (v) the left anterior insular cortex (AIC) extending to frontal orbital cortex (Figure  , Table  ). Most of the included experiments reported “decrease” contrasts (Controls > bvFTD). So, performing ALE analysis on these experiments showed very similar convergent clusters (  P   < .05, cFWE) (Figure  ).

Next, we performed separate ALE analyses for the imaging modality by categorizing the experiments to structural (  N   = 21) and functional (  N   = 17). The ALE analysis of structural (i.e., VBM) experiments revealed clusters of convergence in the amygdala and hippocampus, paracingulate gyrus and frontal medial cortex, as well as the AIC and frontal orbital cortex (  P   < .05, cFWE) (Table  , Figure  ). The location of these clusters corresponded to the first, third, and fifth clusters of the all‐experiments analysis, respectively, but was smaller in size. Confining the analysis to the functional experiments (i.e., FDG‐PET, rs‐fMRI, and t‐fMRI) demonstrated three significant clusters in the left caudate and accumbens, paracingulate gyrus and ACC, and another more rostral region in the ACC (  P   < .05, cFWE). The last cluster, unlike the other two, did not correspond to any of the regions identified in the all‐experiments analysis (Figure  ).

### Connectivity patterns of the identified convergent regions 
  
The MACM and RSFC analyses pointed to the joint networks that are connected to the obtained clusters (Figure  , Figures   and  ). The overlap of MACM and RSFC maps revealed significant task‐based and task‐free co‐activation of the amygdala and hippocampus cluster with the striatum, thalamus, fusiform gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, and midline frontal regions. MACM analysis demonstrated that the amygdala/hippocampus cluster has significant co‐activation with the AIC. In addition, RSFC analysis showed additional task‐free connectivity of amygdala/hippocampus cluster with the entorhinal cortex, superior and middle temporal gyri, precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex, and cerebellum.

The convergent cluster in the left caudate and subcallosal cortex was associated with the striatum, thalamus, AIC, midline frontal regions, posterior cingulate gyrus, and cerebellum in both MACM and RSFC analyses, but with the superior lateral occipital cortex and middle temporal gyrus only in task‐free analysis, and the left superior parietal lobule and parietal operculum only in task‐based analysis. 

The rostral paracingulate and frontal medial cortex cluster showed task‐based coactivation and RSFC with the medial frontal regions, posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, hippocampus, amygdala, and superior lateral occipital cortex, but was also functionally connected to the medial thalamus, AIC, Heschl's gyrus, and cerebellum only in RSFC analysis. Most of the significant regions for this cluster in the MACM analysis were also observed in the RSFC analysis. 

The more caudal significant cluster in the paracingulate and ACC was similarly functionally connected to the medial frontal regions, AIC, striatum, thalamus, middle and inferior frontal gyri, and posterior cingulate cortex in MACM and RSFC analyses, but additionally revealed RSFC with the cerebellum, and meta‐analytic co‐activation with the superior parietal lobule and right angular gyrus. 

The AIC cluster was functionally connected with the paracingulate gyrus and ACC, striatum, thalamus, middle and inferior frontal gyri, superior parietal lobule, and different regions within the cerebellum during both task and rest. In addition, the AIC showed only task‐based functional connectivity with the precentral gyrus, fusiform gyrus, and superior parietal lobule; and RSFC with the temporal pole, Heschl's gyrus, intracalcarine cortex, and lingual gyrus. All these results were corrected for cFWE. 


### Hierarchical clustering of convergent findings 
  
To identify functionally coherent sub‐networks of the identified consistent regions, we performed hierarchical clustering analysis based on their pairwise RSFC profile. In this analysis, at the first level, we identified two main sub‐networks, namely the insula‐amygdala network, and the cingulo‐striatal network including the ACC, paracingulate cortex, frontal medial cortex, subcallosal cortex, and striatum. The latter was grouped into two additional sub‐networks at the second level: one including the two clusters located in the medial frontal lobe, and the other one including the convergent cluster in the striatum and subcallosal cortex (Figure  ).

### Functional decoding of convergent clusters 
  
Our forward‐inference functional decoding of the identified regions using the BrainMap database demonstrated their significant involvement in emotional processing, interoception, reward processing, higher‐order cognitive functions, as well as olfactory and gustatory perception (Figure  ). More specifically, the amygdala/hippocampus cluster was activated in olfactory perception, processing of negative and positive emotions, and reward processing. The convergent cluster in the left caudate and subcallosal cortex was associated primarily with reward processing, gustatory perception, cognitive reasoning, and sexual interoception. Gustatory perception and reward processing were also associated with activations in the rostral paracingulate gyrus/frontal medial cortex cluster. The more caudal paracingulate gyrus and the ACC cluster was more likely to be activated in cognitive reasoning and response to rewards. Finally, the AIC was associated with thermal interoception, processing of disgust, and language semantics. All these results were corrected for false discovery rate (FDR).

## DISCUSSION 
  
We performed a large‐scale CBMA on both structural and functional brain studies on bvFTD, nearly a decade after the revision of its diagnostic criteria, and we found consistent abnormalities in five clusters including the AIC, ACC, paracingulate cortex (PrCC), subcallosal cortex, striatum, amygdala, and anterior hippocampus in patients with bvFTD compared to healthy subjects. These regions predominantly showed decreased gray matter volume, functional hypoactivation, or dysconnectivity, to various degrees in each region. Although the abnormalities in the striatum were mainly functional, structural abnormalities were more predominant in the AIC, amygdala, and anterior hippocampus, and midline frontal regions were both functionally and structurally impaired. In addition, we used MACM and RSFC analyses to characterize the connectivity pattern of the convergent regions and observed significant co‐activation of them with each other, and with additional brain regions including the thalamus, lateral prefrontal cortex, and association cortices in the parietal lobe. Next, using hierarchical clustering of the convergent regions, we classified them into two main groups: one including the AIC, amygdala, and hippocampus, and the other one including the midline frontal areas and striatum. Moreover, functional decoding analysis showed involvement of the former set of regions in emotional processing, and of the latter in reward processing and higher‐order cognitive functions. 

### The key role of the salience network in bvFTD 
  
The cortical layer 5b of AIC and pregenual ACC (pgACC) contains a specialized type of large spindle‐shaped projection neurons called von Economo neurons (VEN), which are presumed to be involved in social cognition and self‐awareness.  The number of these neurons in the AIC and pgACC is significantly depleted in patients with bvFTD, ,  ,   parallel to clinical severity of bvFTD, and even in the absence of gross atrophy of these regions.  Accordingly, histopathological and imaging studies have suggested that the AIC and pgACC are among the earliest atrophied regions in bvFTD.  These regions are the key hubs of the SN, which guides behavior in response to the perceived salience of current external/internal events, that is, their significance for the survival of the individuals.  In this network, the AIC and pgACC play distinct, but interdependent roles, acting as afferent (“sensory”) and efferent (“motor”) hubs of the SN, respectively. More specifically, the AIC detects and represents subjective emotional, homeostatic, social, and motivational salience of the immediate environmental or bodily states, ,   and the ACC initiates goal‐directed behaviors in response to these salient stimuli.  Several studies have reported decreased FC within the SN in patients with bvFTD.  It is well‐documented that the distrubed main hubs of the SN can lead to the main characteristic symptoms of bvFTD, including impaired emotional processing and social cognition, disinhibition, executive dysfunction, and apathy. 

Impaired emotional recognition is a common symptom in bvFTD and has been reported for different types of emotional stimuli, including facial expressions, non‐verbal emotional sounds, or music.  This impairment is selective for negative emotions, and patients’ ability to recognize and react to positive emotions is often spared  or even disproportionately increased.  In addition to emotional recognition, patients with bvFTD have deficits in suppressing emotions, generating emotions, and perceiving self‐conscious emotions.  Decreased gray matter volumes of the amygdala and AIC have been reported in bvFTD patients with impaired emotional recognition of facial expressions.  Amygdala atrophy, similar to AIC, occurs early in the course of bvFTD,  and was consistently reported in our included studies. The amygdala has reciprocal connections to the ventral striatum, as well as limbic and paralimbic brain regions,  and has a central role in recognition of emotions, but also in reward processing, motivation, attention, learning, and memory.  In addition, the amygdala along with the temporal pole, ventral striatum, and thalamus, is responsible for the SN functions that include providing the AIC with the information about socio‐emotional valence of the external and internal world. The information from these different sources is integrated in the AIC, where the salience of the current state is determined/represented and passed on to more downstream regions. 

Lack of empathy, that is, impaired affective social cognition, is a core diagnostic feature of bvFTD  and is related closely to the deficits in emotional processing.  Empathy indicates an ability to identify and share the emotions and needs of other individuals.  Deficits in empathy can have a detrimental effect on the relationships of patients with their relatives and caregivers.  In addition, lack of empathy, and impaired social cognition in general, can result in disinhibition of socially inappropriate behaviors. More specifically, disinhibition might be a consequence of patients’ inability to correctly identify social and emotional signals and their associated punishments/rewards, thereby neglecting the negative consequences of their own social acts.  Recent neuroimaging meta‐analyses on healthy individuals have shown that empathy is consistently associated with activation of regions including the AIC, amygdala, ACC, thalamus, and lateral frontal regions. ,   In addition, individual differences in socioemotional sensitivity have been shown to correlate with FC of the SN,  and interestingly, socio‐affective training aimed at improving empathy and compassion is associated with plasticity of the AIC.  Several neuroimaging studies on the neural correlates of empathy and social cognition in bvFTD patients have pointed to abnormalities in the similar regions, such as the insula, thalamus, amygdala, inferior frontal gyrus, lateral orbitofrontal cortex, and medial frontal regions, including subcallosal and midcingulate cortex. ,  ,  ,   Of interest, similar regions are involved in impaired socio‐emotional dysfunctions of other neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder,  conduct disorder,  and schizophrenia. 

Based on the “simulation theory of empathy,” humans use their own mind as a model to predict and understand the thoughts and feelings of others.  Therefore, and as self‐awareness of affective states largely relies on interoception, that is, awareness of internal bodily homeostatic state, it has been suggested that interoception plays an important role in empathy.  These two closely related functions are presumed to be mediated by the AIC, where dual and corresponding mappings for subjective and empathetic feeling states are represented.  In line with this hypothesis, an fMRI study demonstrated that when subjects are interoceptively aware (attending to their heartbeats), they show a higher empathy‐related brain activity in the AIC after observing emotionally valent facial expressions.  Patients with bvFTD display impaired interoception, as has been shown by their decreased performance in the heartbeat detection task,  or their lower sensitivity to pain and temperature,  which interestingly is associated with the atrophy of insula and fronto‐temporal regions.  The lack of empathy in bvFTD patients could therefore be partially attributable to the impairments in interoception, which are due to AIC dysfunction. 

According to our findings in the AIC, it is worth noting that this convergent cluster was located more on the dorsal surface of the left AIC. This region, as suggested by previous studies and our functional decoding, is more involved in cognitive control and semantic functions,  as opposed to the right and ventral AIC, which has a key role in socio‐emotional processing.  Although we include only studies on bvFTD patients, this finding suggests that some studies might include bvFTD patients with concomitant language abnormalities or semantic variants of FTD. Nevertheless, the segregation of functions in the dorsal and ventral AIC is not as clear‐cut, and different functions of AIC have shown to converge on its dorsal surface.  In addition, our functional decoding analysis showed that the left dorsal AIC is more likely to be activated in interoception than in language functions, and as mentioned earlier, interoception is a key component of empathy. Of note, previous neuroimaging meta‐analyses of empathy have also shown activation of both left and right as well as ventral and dorsal AIC in response to emotional stimuli. 


### Limbic system abnormalities in bvFTD result in executive dysfunction and apathy 
  
The ACC, as the efferent hub of SN, coordinates initiation of appropriate behaviors in response to the states that are emotionally, socially, or homeostatically significant.  This function is mainly accomplished by switching the brain activity from the default mode network (DMN) to the central executive network (CEN),  which refers to the brain areas that are engaged during executive functions, that is, cognitively demanding tasks that require sustained attention, including working memory, problem solving, planning, inhibiting, and development or implementation of strategies.  Executive dysfunction is a prominent symptom and a key diagnostic feature of bvFTD, which affects many domains of higher‐order brain functions, and contributes to development of apathy or inertia (see subsequent text).  Meta‐analytic studies have suggested that in healthy individuals, the frontoparietal and subcortical structures such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, superior parietal lobules, dorsal ACC, thalamus, and striatum are involved in executive functions.  Accordingly, executive dysfunction in bvFTD patients is associated with atrophy of anterior cingulate and midcingulate gyri, medial frontal cortex, and lateral prefrontal cortex.  In the present meta‐analysis, we found consistent abnormalities in the ACC and caudate nucleus in bvFTD patients. These regions were grouped together in the hierarchical clustering, and showed FC with each other, and with other key regions of the CEN including the prefrontal cortex and superior parietal lobule. However, we found no consistent abnormality in the lateral frontal and parietal regions classically associated with executive functions. This finding suggests that in addition to the primary deficits in the ACC and striatum, executive dysfunction in bvFTD patients might be secondary to their inability to engage these lateral cortical regions due to dysfunction in the ACC and SN. Furthermore, because impairments in classical executive functioning tasks occur later in the course of bvFTD,  some patients may not have yet developed abnormalities in lateral regions of the CEN, making it less likely to be identified consistently across the literature. 

Psychopathology of apathy or inertia involves impairments in motivation, initiation, and planning/execution.  Although all three components are dysfunctional in bvFTD patients, lack of motivation is the most prominent abnormality, which contributes to apathy.  Motivation refers to the ability of associating positive or negative affective signals with the value of actions and attempting to maximize value by seeking rewards and avoiding punishments.  In this context, abnormal reward processing can lead to a lack of motivation, both by reducing the inclination to perform and complete tasks and the ability to comprehend the consequences of future actions.  Recent meta‐analysis has shown that in healthy individuals, the striatum, insula, amygdala, thalamus, parahippocampal gyrus, and medial frontal regions such as the ACC are involved in reward processing.  We found convergent abnormalities in many of these reward‐responsive regions including the left caudate, amygdala, paracingulate cortex, frontal medial cortex, and ACC. Of interest, motivational deficits in bvFTD patients are associated with atrophy of the orbitofrontal cortex and ACC.  These findings suggest that lack of motivation in bvFTD patients occurs as a result of their decreased sensitivity to rewards and punishments, due to dysfunction of the ACC, orbitofrontal cortex, and striatum. 


### The role of medial temporal lobe atrophy in amnestic features of bvFTD 
  
Classically bvFTD has been mainly described as a predominantly behavioral disorder with less episodic memory impairment.  However, patients with bvFTD, like other dementia syndromes, may have deficits in encoding and retrieval of autobiographical memories, comparable to that of AD.  It has been reported that impaired episodic memory functions in patients with bvFTD is attributable to their executive dysfunction, that is, their inability to properly monitor topics and events, check the relevance of incoming memories, and inhibit competing memories, due to frontal lobe abnormalities.  Although executive dysfunction can contribute to amnesia, it has been suggested that similar to AD, amnestic bvFTD patients have atrophy or dysfunction of the hippocampus and other medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures. ,   Similar to these original studies, we found convergent atrophy in the CA1 and dentate gyrus of the right anterior hippocampus. However, this finding is rather new compared to previous neuroimaging meta‐analyses on bvFTD, which reported no convergent abnormalities in the MTL. ,  ,   These findings, however, suggest that MTL atrophy and impaired episodic memory exist in bvFTD, and that, therefore, intact memory function may not constitute a suitable differentiating factor between bvFTD and AD.  An alternative explanation might be that because both bvFTD and AD are often diagnosed using clinical diagnostic criteria that are not certain, ,   a portion of clinically diagnosed bvFTD patients, when assessed histopathologically, may actually have AD pathology (e.g., 12 of 63 patients ), or that frontotemporal lobar degeneration  and AD cover a spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders with some bvFTD patients also having underlying AD pathology (and vice versa). 


### Limitations and future directionsf 
  
Our main limitation, which was in fact inherited from the included studies, was the heterogeneity of clinical samples, particularly regarding the severity of symptoms, histopathological subtypes, and molecular etiology of bvFTD. Several studies have suggested that distinct pathological or genetic subtypes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration  have different neuroanatomical correlates.  These subtypes are often difficult to determine, and therefore, very few studies had investigated them separately, preventing us from doing subgroup analyses on those specific subtypes. In addition, because most of the included studies had diagnosed bvFTD using the clinical criteria, it is possible that some of the patients had other disorders characterized by symptoms that can overlap with bvFTD, such as AD or other neuropsychiatric disorders.  Finally, two methodological limitations of our meta‐analysis, which are common to all CBMA methods, were that (1) pooling of findings was based on the peak coordinates of significant regions, which essentially ignores the volume and extent of clusters; and (2) conventional ALE analysis could miss out biological heterogeneity. 

Because novel genetic and histopathological subtypes of bvFTD are introduced (C9ORF72 mutation or microtubule‐associated protein tau (MAPT) expansion carriers or frontotemporal lobe degeneration (FTLD)‐tau and FTLD with TDP‐43 inclusions (FTLD‐TDP), curiosity about the specific clinical and neuroimaging characteristics of these phenotypes is piqued.  Although these phenotypes are not diagnosed appropriately by the present criteria of bvFTD, they do manifest with their individual group of symptoms (e.g., C9ORF72 expansion carriers mostly present with psychiatric symptoms).  Looking further into the neurological and neuroimaging markers of genetically susceptible individuals (e.g., C9ORF72 expansion carriers) might give us invaluable insight into onset and pathophysiology of bvFTD. Therefore, the future individual and meta‐analysis studies on each specific phenotype of bvFTD are a worthwhile endeavor to understand more about bvFTD. 



## CONCLUSION 
  
We replicated some of the findings of previous meta‐analyses on bvFTD in the frontomedial areas, AIC, and striatum. In addition, we identified a cluster of convergence in the amygdala and hippocampus, probably by virtue of a higher number of structural and functional experiments, as well as the increased meta‐analytic power. On the other hand, we found no convergence in some of the regions commonly reported in previous meta‐analyses, namely, the lateral frontal cortical areas and thalamus. The results of our study suggest that: (1) dysfunctions of the AIC and amygdala in bvFTD patients may impair their socio‐emotional processing and may lead to disinhibition of socially inappropriate behaviors and a lack of empathy; (2) abnormalities of midline frontal regions, basal ganglia, and amygdala in patients with bvFTD may be responsible for their executive dysfunction, as well as apathy primarily through a lack of motivation; and (3) hippocampal atrophy and amnestic symptoms may not suitably differentiate bvFTD and AD. In general, our results highlighted a crucial role of the salience network and subcortical regions in pathophysiology of bvFTD.
