2022	VBM of PTSD	Pankey	Brianna/Angie	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36100907/	23 studies	ALE (Structural) + MACM		Structural	MRI studies reporting structural alterations associated with PTSD (VBM) from 2002 to 2020.; “morphometry + PTSD”.		peer-reviewed MRI studies, reporting results among adult humans, written in the English language, focused on gray matter structural differences, and included original data	trauma or stressful life event studies not measuring PTSD, other non-voxel-based morphometry methods, treatment and longitudinal effects, papers reporting a priori regions of interest (ROIs), within-group effects, null effects, overlapping samples to previous studies, and studies that did not report coordinate-based results	85	23	non-PTSD > PTSD
2022	VBM of Substance Use	Hill-Bowen	Lauren	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36115222/	82 studies	ALE (Structural) + MACM		Structural	(“voxel-based morphometry” OR “morphometry” OR “gray matter density” OR “gray matter volume”) AND (“alcohol” OR “nicotine” OR “opiates” OR “stimulants” OR “cocaine” OR “cannabis”); reviewing bibliographies of existing meta-analyses and review articles		First, only empirical English language MRI studies assessing GM volume differences between substance users and controls were included. Second, only studies reporting whole-brain analysis outcomes of lower or higher GM volume were recorded, as region of interest (ROI) analyses violate the ALE null-hypothesis that assumes equal activity across all brain regions. Third, studies reporting foci as 3D coordinates (X, Y, Z) in Talairach or Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) stereotaxic space were included	presence of pharmacological manipulations, brain lesion studies, and studies including participants with reports of mental and/or neurological disorders	4171	82	1) All substances b) Alcohol c) Nicotine d) Alcohol - Nicotine

Second, only studies reporting activity foci as 3D coordinates (X, Y, Z) in Talairach or Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) stereotaxic space were included (studies involving regions of interest [ROIs] derived from a brain parcellation scheme were excluded given the absence of coordinates). Third, experiments reporting coordinates from whole-brain or small-volume corrected analyses involving a within-participant contrast of drug cues>control stimuli or natural reward-related cues>control stimuli were included. 	1) ROI	4000, 3000	133, 63	1) Pooled 2), Common 3) Drug distinct 4) Natural Distinct
2020	Emotion Regulation	Morawetz	Cody	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32659287/	107 studies	Data-Driven Clustering	-7/1/2017	fMRI	 “emotion regulation”, “affective regulation”, “implicit emotion regulation”, “explicit emotion regulation”, “interpersonal emotion regulation”, “extrinsic emotion regulation, “intrinsic emotion regulation”, “reappraisal”, “suppression”, “distraction”, “detachment”, “labelling”, “affective labelling”, “reinterpretation”, “rumination”, “fMRI”, “neuroimaging”, “functional magnetic resonance imaging”, or “functional MRI”.	Journal and PubMed Search	    (1)     We only included data from studies of healthy adults with no prior report of neurological, medical, or psychiatric disorders in the current meta-analysis, while results of patients or specific sub-group effects (e.g., sex differences) were not included. Articles including patients were only selected if they reported results for a control group separately, and only the latter group was included here.     (2)     Only neuroimaging studies, which used whole-brain fMRI and reported coordinates for brain activation or deactivation in standard anatomical reference space (Talairach/Tournoux; Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI)) were considered. To address problems caused by different coordinates used in different studies, coordinates originally published in Talairach space were converted to MNI space using the algorithm implemented in GingerALE 2.3.5 (Laird et al., 2010, 2009; Lancaster et al., 2007).     (3)     Only studies reporting whole brain analyses were included, while studies based on partial coverage or employing only region-of-interest analyses were excluded. 			107	
2020	Decision-Making	Poudel	Ranjita	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32078973/	151 studies	ALE (Functional)	-3/2019	fMRI	(‘fMRI’, ‘BOLD’, ‘risk’, ‘risk-taking’, ‘risky decision-making’, ‘ambiguity’, ‘ambiguous decision-making’, ‘perception’, and ‘perceptual decision-making’) & (‘fMRI’, ‘risk’, ‘risk-taking’, ‘risky decision-making’, ‘nicotine’, ‘alcohol’, ‘marijuana’, ‘cocaine’, ‘methamphetamine’, ‘heroin’, ‘addiction’, ‘drug abuse’, ‘drug addiction’, and ‘substance abuse’)	PubMed/Google Scholar/Web of Science Search	 First, only empirical English language articles using fMRI as a neuroimaging technique were included. We excluded PET studies to remove heterogeneity associated with different neuroimaging modalities. Second, only experiments reporting results from whole-brain analyses were included, as region of interest (ROI) analyses violate the ALE null-hypothesis that assumes equal activity across all brain regions. Third, only experiments reporting activity foci as 3D coordinates (X, Y, Z) in stereotactic (MNI or Talairach) space were included. Coordinates from studies including healthy controls, substance users, as well as participants with other neuropsychiatric conditions (i.e., internet addiction, gambling, internet gaming disorder, obesity, depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, conduct disorders, antisocial personality disorder, and schizophrenia) were utilized in the main analysis. Given that a sizable number of neuroimaging studies have considered risky- and ambiguous-DM among participants diagnosed with various neuropsychiatric conditions, we included studies involving both patient and healthy control samples in our main meta-analysis to be as inclusive as possible. Similarly, participants from all age groups (range: 10–69 years) were also included.		3779, 384, 4560	76, 41, 34	risky-DM (RDM, red), ambiguous-DM (ADM, blue), and perceptual-DM (PDM, green)

Moreover, the current meta-analysis was limited to contrasts between cannabis users and non-users, omitting contrasts involving groups specifically selected for having mental health disorders and diseases. Published papers that examined one or more clinical groups (e.g. schizophrenia, bipolar disorder) were carefully reviewed using the inclusion/exclusion criteria.  In addition, pharmacologic assessments characterizing acute cannabis administration were not considered.			users < non-users ; users > non-users
